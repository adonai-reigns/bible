\begin{biblechapter} % Hebrews 1
\verseWithHeading{God’s Full and Final Revelation in the Son} \textit{Although} God spoke long ago in many parts and in many ways to the fathers by the prophets,
\verse in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all \textit{things}, through whom also he made the world,
\verse who is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence, sustaining all \textit{things} by the word of power. \textit{When he} had made purification for sins through him, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
\verse having become by so much better than the angels, by as much as he has inherited a more excellent name than theirs.
\verseWithHeading{The Son Superior to the Angels} For to which of the angels did he ever say, “You are my son, 
today I have begotten you,” and again, “I will be \textit{his father}, 
and he will be \textit{my son}”?
\verse And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, “And let all \textit{the} angels of God worship him.”
\verse And concerning the angels he says, “The one who makes his angels winds, 
and his servants a flame of fire,”
\verse but concerning the Son,
\verse “Your throne, O God, \textit{is} \textit{forever and ever}, 
and the scepter of righteous \textit{is the} scepter of your kingdom.
\verse And,
\verse “You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, 
and the heavens are the works of your hands;
\verse they will perish, but you continue, 
and they will all become old like a garment,
\verse But to which of the angels has he ever said, “Sit down at my right hand, 
until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”
\verse Are they not all spirits engaged in special service, sent on assignment for the sake of those who are going to inherit salvation?
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hebrews 2
\verseWithHeading{Warning Not to Neglect Salvation} Because of this, \textit{it is} all the more necessary \textit{that} we pay attention to the \textit{things} we have heard, lest we drift away.
\verse For if the word spoken through angels was binding and every transgression and act of disobedience received a just penalty,
\verse how will we escape \textit{if we} neglect so great a salvation which had \textit{its} beginning \textit{when it} was spoken through the Lord \textit{and} was confirmed to us by those who heard,
\verse \textit{while} God was testifying at the same time by signs and wonders and various miracles and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his will.
\verseWithHeading{The Son’s Humiliation and Suffering} For he did not subject to angels the world to come, about which we are speaking.
\verse But someone testified somewhere, saying,
\verse “What is man, that you remember him, 
or the son of man, that you care for him?
\verse You made him for a short \textit{time} lower than the angels; 
you crowned him with glory and honor;
\verse For in subjecting all \textit{things}, he left nothing \textit{that was} not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all \textit{things} subjected to him,
\verse but we see Jesus, for a short \textit{time} made lower than the angels, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that apart from God he might taste death on behalf of everyone.
\verse For it was fitting for him for whom \textit{are} all \textit{things} and through whom \textit{are} all \textit{things} in bringing many sons to glory to perfect the originator of their salvation through sufferings.
\verse For both the one who sanctifies and the ones who are sanctified \textit{are} all from one, for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers, “I will proclaim your name to my brothers; 
in the midst of the assembly I will sing in praise of you.”
\verse And again, “I will trust in him.” And again, “Behold, I and the children God has given me.”
\verse Therefore, since the children share in blood and flesh, he also in like manner shared in these \textit{same things}, in order that through death he could destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,
\verse and could set free these who through fear of death were subject to slavery throughout all their lives.
\verse For surely he is not concerned with angels, but he is concerned with the descendants of Abraham.
\verse Therefore he was obligated to be made like his brothers in all \textit{respects}, in order that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in the things relating to God, in order to make atonement for the sins of the people.
\verse For in that which he himself suffered \textit{when he} was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hebrews 3
\verseWithHeading{The Superiority of Jesus to Moses} Therefore, holy brothers, sharers in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,
\verse who was faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses also \textit{was} in his household.
\verse For this one is considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, inasmuch as the one who builds it has greater honor than the house.
\verse For every house is built by someone, but the one who built all \textit{things} \textit{is} God.
\verse And Moses \textit{was} faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony to the things that would be spoken,
\verse but Christ \textit{was faithful} as a son over his house, whose house we are, if we hold fast to our confidence and the hope we can be proud of.
\verseWithHeading{A Serious Warning Against Unbelief} Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says,
\verse “Today, if you hear his voice,
\verse do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, 
in the day of testing in the wilderness,
\verse where your fathers tested \textit{me} by trial 
and saw my works
\verse \textit{for} forty years. 
Therefore I was angry with this generation, 
and I said, ‘They always go astray in their heart, 
and they do not know my ways.’
\verse Watch out, brothers, lest there be in some of you an evil, unbelieving heart, \textit{with the result that you} fall away from the living God.
\verse But encourage one another \textit{day by day}, as long as it is called “today,” so that \textit{none of you become hardened} by the deception of sin.
\verse For we have become partners of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of \textit{our} commitment steadfast until the end,
\verse \textit{while it is said}, “Today, if you hear his voice, 
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”
\verse For who, \textit{when they} heard \textit{it}, were disobedient? Surely \textit{it was} not all who went out from Egypt through Moses?
\verse And with whom was he angry \textit{for} forty years? \textit{Was it} not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?
\verse And to whom did he swear \textit{they would} not enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient?
\verse And \textit{so} we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hebrews 4
\verseWithHeading{The Rest that Remains for the People of God} Therefore let us fear, \textit{while there} remains a promise of entering into his rest, that none of you appear to fall short of \textit{it}.
\verse \textit{For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us}, just as those also \textit{did}, but the message \textit{they heard} did not benefit them, \textit{because they} were not united with those who heard \textit{it} in faith.
\verse For we who have believed enter into rest, just as he has said, “As I swore in my anger, 
‘\textit{They will never enter} into my rest.’ ”
\verse And yet these works have been accomplished from the foundation of the world.
\verse For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh \textit{day} in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,”
\verse and in this \textit{passage} again, ‘\textit{They will never enter} into my rest.’ ”
\verse Since therefore it remains \textit{for} some to enter into it, and the ones to whom the good news was proclaimed previously did not enter because of disobedience, “Today, if you hear his voice, 
do not harden your hearts.”
\verse For if Joshua had caused them to rest, he would not have spoken about another day after these \textit{things}.
\verse Consequently a sabbath rest remains for the people of God.
\verse For the one who has entered into his rest has also himself rested from his works, just as God \textit{did} from his own \textit{works}.
\verse Therefore, let us make every effort to enter into that rest, in order that no one may fall in the same pattern of disobedience.
\verse For the word of God \textit{is} living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, both joints and marrow, and able to judge the reflections and thoughts of the heart.
\verse And no creature is hidden in the sight of him, but all \textit{things are} naked and laid bare to the eyes of him to whom \textit{we must give our account}.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Our Great High Priest} Therefore, \textit{because we} have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.
\verse For we do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our weaknesses, but who has been tempted in all \textit{things} in the same way, without sin.
\verse Therefore let us approach with confidence to the throne of grace, in order that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hebrews 5
\verseWithHeading{A High Priest Like Melchizedek} For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on behalf of people in the things relating to God, in order that he can offer both gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins,
\verse being able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and led astray, since he himself also is surrounded by weakness,
\verse and because of it he is obligated to offer \textit{sacrifices} for sins \textit{for himself also, as well as for the people}.
\verse And someone does not take for himself the honor, but is called by God, just as Aaron also \textit{was}.
\verse Thus also Christ did not glorify himself to become high priest, but the one who said to him, “You are my Son, today I have begotten you,”
\verse just as also in another \textit{place} he says, “You \textit{are} a priest \textit{forever} according to the order of Melchizedek,”
\verse who in the days of his flesh offered up both prayers and supplications, with loud crying and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard as a result of his reverence.
\verse Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered,
\verse and being perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey him,
\verse being designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
\verseWithHeading{Advanced Teaching Hindered by Immaturity} Concerning this \textit{we have much to say and it is difficult to explain}, since you have become sluggish in hearing.
\verse For indeed, \textit{although you} ought to be teachers \textit{by this time}, you have need of someone to teach you again the beginning elements of the oracles of God, and \textit{you have need of} milk, not solid food.
\verse For everyone who partakes of milk \textit{is} unacquainted with the message of righteousness, because he is an infant.
\verse But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have trained their faculties for the distinguishing of both good and evil.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hebrews 6
\verseWithHeading{A Serious Warning Against Falling Away} Therefore, leaving behind the elementary message about Christ, let us move on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God,
\verse teaching about baptisms and laying on of hands, and resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.
\verse And this we will do, if God permits.
\verse For \textit{it is} impossible \textit{concerning} those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and become sharers of the Holy Spirit,
\verse and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age,
\verse and having fallen away, to renew \textit{them} again to repentance, \textit{because they} have crucified again for themselves the Son of God and held him up to contempt.
\verse For ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth vegetation usable to those \textit{people} \textit{for whose sake} \textit{it is} also cultivated, shares a blessing from God.
\verse But \textit{if it} produces thorns and thistles, \textit{it is} worthless and near to a curse, whose end \textit{is} for burning.
\verse But even if we are speaking in this way, dear friends, we are convinced of better \textit{things} concerning you, and belonging to salvation.
\verse For God \textit{is} not unjust, \textit{so as} to forget your work and the love which you demonstrated for his name \textit{by} having served the saints, and continuing to serve \textit{them}.
\verse And we desire each one of you to demonstrate the same diligence for the full assurance of \textit{your} hope until the end,
\verse in order that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and patience.
\verseWithHeading{The Reliability of God’s Promise} For \textit{when} God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater to swear by, he swore by himself,
\verse saying, “Surely \textit{I will greatly bless} you, and \textit{I will greatly multiply} you.”
\verse And so, \textit{by} persevering, he obtained the promise.
\verse For people swear by what is greater \textit{than themselves}, and the oath for confirmation \textit{is the} end of all dispute for them.
\verse In the same way God, \textit{because he} wanted to show even more to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his resolve, guaranteed \textit{it} with an oath,
\verse in order that through two unchangeable things, in which \textit{it is} impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge may have powerful encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before \textit{us},
\verse which we have like an anchor of the soul, both firm and steadfast, and entering into the inside of the curtain,
\verse where Jesus, the forerunner for us, entered, \textit{because he} became a high priest \textit{forever} according to the order of Melchizedek.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hebrews 7
\verseWithHeading{The Greatness of Melchizedek} For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham \textit{as he} was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
\verse to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of everything—in the first place, \textit{his name} is translated “king of righteousness,” and then also “king of Salem,” that is, “king of peace”;
\verse without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God—he remains a priest for all time.
\verse But see how great this man \textit{was}, to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth from the spoils!
\verse And indeed those of the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have a commandment to collect a tenth from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, although \textit{they are descended from Abraham}.
\verse But the one who did not trace \textit{his} descent from them collected tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.
\verse Now without any dispute the inferior is blessed by the more prominent.
\verse And in this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case it is testified that he lives.
\verse And, \textit{so to speak}, even Levi, the one who receives tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham.
\verse For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
\verseWithHeading{The Superiority of Jesus to Melchizedek} Thus if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood, for on the basis of it the people received the law, what further need \textit{is there} for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and not said to be according to the order of Aaron?
\verse For \textit{when} the priesthood changes, of necessity there is a change of the law also.
\verse For the one about whom these \textit{things} are spoken belongs to another tribe from which no one has officiated at the altar.
\verse For \textit{it is} evident that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, a tribe \textit{with reference} to which Moses said nothing concerning priests.
\verse And it is still more clear, if another priest according to the likeness of Melchizedek arises,
\verse who has become \textit{a priest} not according to a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.
\verse For it is testified, “You \textit{are} a priest \textit{forever} according to the order of Melchizedek.”
\verse For on the one hand a preceding commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness
\verse (for the law \textit{made} nothing perfect), but on the other hand \textit{there is} the introduction of a better hope through which we draw near to God.
\verse And by as much as \textit{this was} not without an oath (for these on the one hand \textit{have become priests} without an oath,
\verse but he with an oath by the one who said to him, “The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, 
‘You \textit{are} a priest \textit{forever}’ ”),
\verse by so much more Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.
\verse And indeed many \textit{have become} priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing \textit{in office},
\verse but he, because he continues \textit{forever}, holds the priesthood permanently.
\verse Therefore also he is able to save completely those who draw near to God through him, \textit{because he} always lives in order to intercede on their behalf.
\verse For a high priest such as this indeed is fitting for us, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and having become exalted \textit{above} the heavens,
\verse who does not \textit{need every day} like the former high priests to offer up sacrifices for his own sins \textit{and} then for the \textit{sins} of the people, because he did this once for all \textit{when he} offered up himself.
\verse For the law appoints men \textit{as} high priests who have weakness, but the statement of the oath, after the law, \textit{appoints} a Son, who is made perfect \textit{forever}.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hebrews 8
\verseWithHeading{The Mediator of a New and Better Covenant} Now \textit{this is} the main point in what has been said: we have a high priest such as this, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
\verse a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord set up, not man.
\verse For every high priest is appointed in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices; therefore \textit{it was} necessary \textit{for} this one also to have something that he offers.
\verse Now if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, \textit{because there} are those who offer the gifts according to the law,
\verse who serve a sketch and shadow of the heavenly \textit{things}, just as Moses was warned \textit{when he} was about to complete the tabernacle, for he says, “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain.”
\verse But now he has attained a more excellent ministry, by as much as he is also mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted upon better promises.
\verse For if that first \textit{covenant} had been faultless, occasion would not have been sought for a second.
\verse For in finding fault with them he says,
\verse “Behold, days are coming, says the Lord, 
when I will complete a new covenant with the house of Israel 
and with the house of Judah,
\verse not like the covenant which I made with their fathers 
on the day I took hold of them by my hand 
to lead them out of the land of Egypt, 
because they did not continue in my covenant 
and I disregarded them, says the Lord.
\verse For this \textit{is} the covenant that I will decree with the house of Israel 
after those days, says the Lord: 
I am putting my laws in their minds 
and I will write them on their hearts, 
and I will be \textit{their} God 
and they will be \textit{my} people.
\verse And they will not teach each one his fellow citizen 
and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ 
because they will all know me, 
from the least of them to the greatest.
\verse In calling \textit{it} new, he has declared the former \textit{to be old}. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old \textit{is} near to disappearing.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hebrews 9
\verseWithHeading{The Earthly Ministry of the Old Covenant} Now the first \textit{covenant} had regulations for worship and the earthly sanctuary.
\verse For a tent was prepared, the first \textit{one}, in which \textit{were} the lampstand and the table and the presentation of the loaves, which is called the holy place.
\verse And after the second curtain \textit{was} a tent called the holy of holies,
\verse containing the golden incense altar and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which \textit{were} a golden jar containing the manna and the rod of Aaron that budded and the tablets of the covenant.
\verse And above it \textit{were} the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, about which it is not now \textit{possible} to speak in detail.
\verse Now these things having been prepared in this way, the priests enter into the first tent \textit{continually} \textit{as they} accomplish their service,
\verse but only the high priest \textit{enters} into the second \textit{tent} once a year, not without blood, which he offers on behalf of himself and the \textit{sins} of the people committed in ignorance.
\verse The Holy Spirit \textit{was} making this clear, \textit{that} the way \textit{into} the holy place \textit{was} not yet revealed, \textit{while} the first tent was still in existence,
\verse which \textit{was} a symbol for the present time, in which both the gifts and sacrifices which were offered were not able to perfect the worshiper with respect to the conscience,
\verse concerning \textit{instead} only food and drink and different washings, regulations of outward things imposed until the time of setting \textit{things} right.
\verseWithHeading{The Heavenly Ministry of the New Covenant} But Christ has arrived \textit{as} a high priest of the good \textit{things} to come. Through the greater and more perfect tent not made by hands, that is, not of this creation,
\verse and not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered once for all into the \textit{most} holy place, obtaining eternal redemption.
\verse For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled sanctify \textit{them} for the ritual purity of the flesh,
\verse how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works to serve \textit{the} living God?
\verse And because of this, he is the mediator of a new covenant, in order that, \textit{because} a death has taken place for the redemption of transgressions \textit{committed} during the first covenant, those who are the called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
\verse For where \textit{there is} a will, \textit{it is} a necessity \textit{for} the death of the one who made the will to be established.
\verse For a will \textit{is} in force concerning those who are dead, since \textit{it is} never in force when the one who made the will is alive.
\verse Therefore not even the first \textit{covenant} was ratified without blood.
\verse For \textit{when} every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, \textit{he} took the blood of calves with water and scarlet wool and hyssop \textit{and} sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people,
\verse saying, “This \textit{is} the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you.”
\verse And likewise he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the utensils of service with the blood.
\verse Indeed, nearly everything is purified with blood according to the law, and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
\verse Therefore \textit{it was} necessary \textit{for} the sketches of the \textit{things} in heaven to be purified with these \textit{sacrifices}, but the heavenly \textit{things} themselves \textit{to be purified} with better sacrifices than these.
\verse For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands, a \textit{mere} copy of the true \textit{one}, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf,
\verse and not in order that he can offer himself many times, as the high priest enters into the sanctuary \textit{year by year} with blood not his own,
\verse since it would have been necessary for him to suffer many times from the foundation of the world, but now he has appeared once at the end of the ages for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of himself.
\verse And \textit{just as} it is destined for people to die once, and after this, judgment,
\verse thus also Christ, having been offered once in order to bear the sins of many, will appear for the second time without reference to sin to those who eagerly await him for salvation.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hebrews 10
\verseWithHeading{Christ’s One Sacrifice for Sin} For the law, possessing a shadow of the good \textit{things} that are about to come, not the form of things itself, \textit{is} never able \textit{year by year} by means of the same sacrifices which they offer without interruption to make perfect those who draw near.
\verse For otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the ones who worship, having been purified once and for all, would no longer have any consciousness of sins?
\verse But in them \textit{there is} a reminder of sins \textit{year by year}.
\verse For \textit{it is} impossible \textit{for} the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
\verse Therefore, \textit{when he} came into the world, he said,
\verse “Sacrifice and offering you did not want, 
but a body you prepared for me;
\verse you did not delight in whole burnt offerings and \textit{offerings} for sins.
\verse \textit{When he} says above, “Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and \textit{offerings} for sin 
you did not want, nor did you delight in,”
\verse which are offered according to the law, “Behold, I have come to do your will.”
\verse He takes away the first in order to establish the second,
\verse And every priest stands every day serving and offering the same sacrifices many times, which are never able to take away sins.
\verse But this one, \textit{after he} had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God,
\verse from now on waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet.
\verse For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy.
\verse And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,
\verse “This \textit{is} the covenant that I will decree for them 
after those days, says the Lord: 
I am putting my laws on their hearts, 
and I will write them on their minds.”
\verse \textit{He} also \textit{says}, “Their sins and their lawless deeds I will never remember again.”
\verse Now where \textit{there is} forgiveness of these, \textit{there is} no longer an offering for sin.
\verseWithHeading{Hold Fast the Confession of Our Hope} Therefore, brothers, \textit{since we} have confidence for the entrance into the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,
\verse \textit{by the} new and living way which he inaugurated for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh,
\verse and \textit{since we have} a great priest over the house of God,
\verse let us approach with a true heart in the full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled \textit{clean} from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
\verse Let us hold fast to the confession of \textit{our} hope without wavering, for the one who promised \textit{is} faithful.
\verse And let us think about \textit{how to stir one another up to love} and good works,
\verse not abandoning \textit{our meeting together}, as \textit{is} the habit of some, but encouraging \textit{each other}, and by so much more as you see the day drawing near.
\verseWithHeading{A Serious Warning Against Continuing Deliberate Sin} For \textit{if} we keep on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
\verse but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that is about to consume the adversaries.
\verse Anyone who rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy on \textit{the testimony of} two or three witnesses.
\verse How much worse punishment do you think the person will be considered worthy of who treats with disdain the Son of God and who considers ordinary the blood of the covenant by which he was made holy and who insults the Spirit of grace?
\verse For we know the one who said, “Vengeance \textit{is} mine, I will repay,” and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”
\verse \textit{It is} a terrifying \textit{thing} to fall into the hands of the living God.
\verse But remember the former days in which, \textit{after you} were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings,
\verse sometimes being publicly exposed both to insults and to afflictions, and sometimes becoming sharers with those who were treated in this way.
\verse For you both sympathized with the prisoners and put up with the seizure of your belongings with joy \textit{because you} knew that you yourselves had a better and permanent possession.
\verse Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has great reward.
\verse For you have need of endurance, in order that \textit{after you} have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.
\verse For yet
\verse “a very, very little \textit{while}, 
\textit{and} the one who is coming will come and will not delay.
\verse But we are not among those who shrink back to destruction, but among those who have faith to the preservation of \textit{our} souls.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hebrews 11
\verseWithHeading{Examples of Faith in Action} Now faith is the realization of what is hoped for, the proof of things not seen.
\verse For by this the people of old were approved.
\verse By faith we understand the worlds were created by the word of God, in order that what is seen did not come into existence from what is visible.
\verse By faith Abel offered to God a greater sacrifice than Cain, by which he was approved that he was righteous, \textit{because} God approved \textit{him} for his gifts, and through it he still speaks, \textit{although he} is dead.
\verse By faith Enoch was taken up, so that he did not experience death, and he was not found, because God took him up. For before his removal, he had been approved \textit{as having been pleasing} to God.
\verse Now without faith \textit{it is} impossible to please \textit{him}, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and is a rewarder of those who seek him.
\verse By faith Noah, having been warned about things not yet seen, out of reverence constructed an ark for the deliverance of his family, by which he pronounced sentence on the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.
\verse By faith Abraham, \textit{when he} was called, obeyed to go out to a place that he was going to receive for an inheritance, and he went out, not knowing where he was going.
\verse By faith he lived in the land of promise as a stranger, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the fellow heirs of the same promise.
\verse For he was expecting the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder \textit{is} God.
\verse By faith also, \textit{with Sarah}, he received \textit{the ability to procreate} even \textit{past the normal age}, because he regarded the one who had promised \textit{to be} faithful.
\verse And therefore these were fathered from one man, and \textit{he} being as good as dead, as the stars of heaven in number and like the innumerable sand by the shore of the sea.
\verse These all died in faith without receiving the promises, but seeing them from a distance and welcoming \textit{them}, and admitting that they were strangers and temporary residents on the earth.
\verse For those who say such \textit{things} make clear that they are seeking a homeland.
\verse And if they remember that \textit{land} from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.
\verse But now they aspire to a better \textit{land}, that is, a heavenly \textit{one}. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.
\verse By faith Abraham, \textit{when he} was tested, offered Isaac, and the one who received the promises was ready to offer his one and only \textit{son},
\verse with reference to whom it was said, “In Isaac your descendants will be named,”
\verse having reasoned that God \textit{was} able even to raise \textit{him} from the dead, from which he received him back also as a symbol.
\verse By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things that were going to happen.
\verse By faith Jacob, \textit{as he} was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped, \textit{leaning} on the top of his staff.
\verse By faith Joseph, \textit{as he} was dying, mentioned about the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave instructions about his bones.
\verse By faith Moses, \textit{when he} was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw the child \textit{was} handsome, and they were not afraid of the edict of the king.
\verse By faith Moses, \textit{when he} was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,
\verse choosing instead to be mistreated with the people of God \textit{rather} than to experience the transitory enjoyment of sin,
\verse considering \textit{reproach endured for the sake of Christ} greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.
\verse By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king, for he persevered as \textit{if he} saw the invisible one.
\verse By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, in order that the one who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them.
\verse By faith they crossed the Red Sea as if on dry land; the Egyptians, \textit{when they made the attempt}, were drowned.
\verse By faith the walls of Jericho fell down \textit{after they} had been marched around for seven days.
\verse By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, \textit{because she} welcomed the spies in peace.
\verse And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, and Samuel and the prophets,
\verse who through faith conquered kingdoms, accomplished justice, obtained what was promised, shut the mouths of lions,
\verse extinguished the effectiveness of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong from weakness, became mighty in battle, put to flight enemy battle lines.
\verse Women received back their dead by resurrection. But others were tortured, not accepting release, in order that they might gain a better resurrection.
\verse And others \textit{experienced mocking and flogging}, and in addition bonds and imprisonment.
\verse They were stoned, they were sawed in two, they died by murder with a sword, they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, impoverished, afflicted, mistreated,
\verse of whom the world was not worthy, wandering about on deserts and mountains and in caves and in holes in the ground.
\verse And \textit{although they} all were approved through their faith, they did not receive what was promised,
\verse \textit{because} God had provided something better for us, so that they would not be made perfect without us.

\begin{biblechapter} % Hebrews 12
\verseWithHeading{The Example of Jesus’ Suffering} Therefore, \textit{since} we also have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us, putting aside every weight and \textit{the sin that so easily ensnares us}, let us run with patient endurance the race that has been set before us,
\verse fixing our eyes on Jesus, the originator and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
\verse For consider the one who endured such hostility by sinners against himself, so that you will not grow weary in your souls \textit{and} give up.
\verse You have not yet resisted to the point of \textit{shedding your} blood \textit{as you} struggle against sin.
\verse And have you completely forgotten the exhortation which instructs you as sons?
\verse “My son, do not make light of the Lord’s discipline, 
or give up \textit{when you} are corrected by him.
\verse Endure \textit{it} for discipline. God is dealing with you as sons. For what son \textit{is there} whom a father does not discipline?
\verse But if you are without discipline, in which all \textit{legitimate sons} have become participants, then you are illegitimate and not sons.
\verse Furthermore, we have had \textit{our earthly fathers} who disciplined \textit{us}, and we respected \textit{them}. Will we not much rather subject ourselves to the Father of spirits and live?
\verse For they disciplined \textit{us} for a few days according to what seemed \textit{appropriate} to them, but he \textit{does so} for our benefit, in order that \textit{we} can have a share in his holiness.
\verse Now all discipline seems for the moment not to be joyful but painful, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness for those who are trained by it.
\verseWithHeading{A Serious Warning Against Refusing God} Therefore strengthen your slackened hands and your weakened knees,
\verse and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame will not be dislocated, but rather be healed.
\verse Pursue peace with everyone, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.
\verse Take care \textit{that} no one falls short of the grace of God; \textit{that} no one growing up \textit{like} a root of bitterness causes trouble, and by it many become defiled;
\verse \textit{that} no one \textit{be} a sexually immoral or totally worldly \textit{person} like Esau, who for one meal traded his own birthright.
\verse For you know that also afterwards, \textit{when he} wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, because he did not find an occasion for repentance, although he sought it with tears.
\verse For you have not come to something that can be touched, and to a burning fire, and to darkness, and to gloom, and to a whirlwind,
\verse and to the noise of a trumpet, and to the sound of words which those who heard begged \textit{that} not \textit{another} word be spoken to them.
\verse For they could not endure what was commanded: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned.”
\verse And the spectacle was so terrifying \textit{that} Moses said, “I am terrified and trembling.”
\verse But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to tens of thousands of angels, to the festal gathering
\verse and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous \textit{people} made perfect,
\verse and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and \textit{to the sprinkled blood} that speaks better than Abel’s \textit{does}.
\verse Watch out that you do not refuse the one who is speaking! For if those did not escape \textit{when they} refused the one who warned \textit{them} on earth, much less \textit{will} we \textit{escape}, \textit{if we} reject the \textit{one who warns} from heaven,
\verse whose voice shook the earth at that time, but now he has promised, saying, “Yet once \textit{more} I will shake not only the earth but also heaven.”
\verse Now the \textit{phrase} “yet once \textit{more}” indicates the removal of what is shaken, namely, things that have been created, in order that the things that are not shaken may remain.
\verse Therefore, \textit{since we} are receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us be thankful, through which let us serve God acceptably, with awe and reverence.
\verse For indeed our God \textit{is} a consuming fire.

\begin{biblechapter} % Hebrews 13
\verseWithHeading{Concluding Ethical Instructions} Brotherly love must continue.
\verse Do not neglect hospitality, because through this some have received angels as guests without knowing \textit{it}.
\verse Remember the prisoners, as \textit{though you were} fellow-prisoners; \textit{remember} the mistreated, as \textit{though} \textit{you} yourselves also are being \textit{mistreated} in the body.
\verse Marriage \textit{must be} held in honor by all, and the marriage bed \textit{be} undefiled, because God will judge sexually immoral people and adulterers.
\verse Your lifestyle \textit{must be} free from the love of money, being content with what you have. For he himself has said, “I will never desert you, and I will never abandon you.”
\verse So then, we can say with confidence, “The Lord \textit{is} my helper, I will not be afraid. 
What will man do to me?”
\verse Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you; \textit{considering the outcome of their way of life}, imitate their faith.
\verse Jesus Christ \textit{is} the same yesterday and today and \textit{forever}.
\verse Do not be carried away by various and strange teachings, for \textit{it is} good \textit{for} the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods by which those who participate have not benefited.
\verse We have an altar from which those who serve in the tabernacle do not have the right to eat.
\verse For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sins are burned up outside the camp.
\verse Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the gate, in order that he might sanctify the people by his own blood.
\verse So we must go out to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.
\verse For here we do not have a permanent city, but we seek the \textit{city} that is to come.
\verse Therefore through him let us offer up a sacrifice of praise \textit{continually} to God, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name.
\verse And do not neglect doing good and generosity, for God is pleased with such sacrifices.
\verse Obey your leaders and submit \textit{to them}, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account, so that they can do this with joy and not \textit{with} groaning, for this \textit{would be} unprofitable for you.
\verse Pray for us, for we are convinced that we have a good conscience, \textit{and} want to conduct ourselves commendably in every \textit{way}.
\verse And I especially urge \textit{you} to do this, so that I may be restored to you more quickly.
\verseWithHeading{Benediction} Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant,
\verse equip you with every good \textit{thing} to do his will, carrying out in us \textit{what is} pleasing before him through Jesus Christ, to whom \textit{be} the glory \textit{forever}. Amen.
\verseWithHeading{Conclusion} Now I urge you, brothers, bear with my word of exhortation, for indeed I have written to you \textit{briefly}.
\verse Know \textit{that} our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I will see you, if he comes quickly \textit{enough}.
\verse Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.
\verse Grace \textit{be} with all of you.
