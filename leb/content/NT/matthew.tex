\verseWithHeading{Wise Men Visit Jesus} Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem,
\verse saying, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star at its rising and have come to worship him.”
\verse And when King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him,
\verse and after calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired from them where the Christ was to be born.
\verse So they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet,
\verse ‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, 
are by no means least among the rulers of Judah, 
for from you will go out a ruler 
who will shepherd my people Israel.’ ”
\verse Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and determined precisely from them the time when the star appeared.
\verse And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go, inquire carefully concerning the child, and when you have found him, report to me so that I also may come and worship him.”
\verse After they listened to the king, they went out, and behold, the star which they had seen at its rising led them until it came and stood above the place where the child was.
\verse Now when they saw the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.
\verse And when they came into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. And opening their treasure boxes, they offered him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.
\verse And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country by another route.
\verseWithHeading{Joseph, Mary, and Jesus Escape to Egypt} Now after they had gone away, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him.”
\verse So he got up and took the child and his mother during the night and went away to Egypt.
\verse And he was there until the death of Herod, in order that what was said by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”
\verseWithHeading{Herod Has Innocent Children Murdered} Then Herod, when he saw that he had been deceived by the wise men, became very angry, and he sent soldiers and executed all the children in Bethlehem and in all the region around it from the age of two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined precisely from the wise men.
\verse Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, saying,
\verse “A voice was heard in Ramah, 
weeping and great mourning, 
Rachel weeping for her children, 
and she did not want to be comforted, 
because \textit{they exist no longer}.”
\verseWithHeading{Joseph, Mary, and Jesus Return to Nazareth} Now after Herod had died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
\verse saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the life of the child are dead.”
\verse So he got up and took the child and his mother and \textit{entered} the land of Israel.

\verseWithHeading{John the Baptist Begins His Ministry} Now in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the Judean wilderness
\verse and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near!”
\verse For this is the one who was spoken about by the prophet Isaiah, saying, “The voice of one crying out in the wilderness, 
‘Prepare the way of the Lord, 
make his paths straight.’ ”
\verse Now John himself had his clothing made from camel’s hair and a belt made of leather around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
\verse Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the district around the Jordan were going out to him,
\verse and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.
\verse But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
\verse Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance!
\verse And do not think to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones!
\verse Already now the ax is positioned at the root of the trees; therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
\verse I baptize you with water for repentance, but the one who comes after me is more powerful than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
\verse His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will clean out his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
\verseWithHeading{The Baptism of Jesus} Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John in order to be baptized by him.
\verse But John tried to prevent him, saying, “\textit{I need} to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”
\verse But Jesus answered and said to him, “Permit it now, for in this way it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he permitted him.
\verse Now after he was baptized, Jesus immediately went up from the water, and behold, the heavens opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove coming upon him.
\verse And behold, there was a voice from heaven saying, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Matthew 4
\verseWithHeading{The Temptation of Jesus} Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil,
\verse and after he had fasted forty days and forty nights, then he was hungry.
\verse And the tempter approached and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, order that these stones become bread.”
\verse But he answered and said, “It is written, ‘Man will not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God.”
\verse Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the highest point of the temple
\verse and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down! For it is written, ‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and ‘On their hands they will lift you up, 
lest you strike your foot against a stone.’ ”
\verse Jesus said to him, “On the other hand it is written, ‘You are not to put the Lord your God to the test.’ ”
\verse Again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,
\verse and he said to him, “I will give to you all these things, if you will fall down and worship me.”
\verse Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan, for it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’ ”
\verse Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and began ministering to him.
\verseWithHeading{Public Ministry in Galilee} Now when he heard that John \textit{had been arrested}, he withdrew into Galilee.
\verse And leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
\verse in order that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said,
\verse “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, 
\textit{toward the sea}, on the other side of the Jordan, 
Galilee of the Gentiles—
\verse the people who sit in darkness 
have seen a great light, 
and the ones who sit in the land and shadow of death, 
a light has dawned on them.”
\verse From that time on, Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven is near.”
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Calls His First Disciples} Now as he was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew, throwing a casting net into the sea (for they were fishermen).
\verse And he said to them, “\textit{Follow me} and I will make you fishers of people.”
\verse And immediately they left their nets and followed him.
\verse And going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.
\verse And immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
\verseWithHeading{Teaching, Preaching, and Healing throughout Galilee} And he went around through all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
\verse And a report about him went out \textit{throughout} Syria, and they brought to him all those \textit{who were sick} with various diseases and afflicted by torments, demon-possessed and epileptics and paralytics, and he healed them.
\verse And large crowds followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from the other side of the Jordan.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Matthew 5
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: The Beatitudes} Now when he saw the crowds, he went up the mountain and after he sat down, his disciples approached him.
\verse And opening his mouth he began to teach them, saying,
\verse “Blessed are the poor in spirit, 
because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\verse Blessed are the ones who mourn, 
because they will be comforted.
\verse Blessed are the meek, 
because they will inherit the earth.
\verse Blessed are the ones who hunger and thirst for righteousness, 
because they will be satisfied.
\verse Blessed are the merciful, 
because they will be shown mercy.
\verse Blessed are the pure in heart, 
because they will see God.
\verse Blessed are the peacemakers, 
because they will be called sons of God.
\verse Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, 
because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\verse Blessed are you 
when they insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things against you, lying on account of me.
\verse Rejoice and be glad, because your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you.
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: Salt and Light} “You are the salt of the earth. But if salt becomes tasteless, by what will it be made salty? It is good for nothing any longer except to be thrown outside and trampled under foot by people.
\verse You are the light of the world. A city located on top of a hill cannot be hidden,
\verse nor do they light a lamp and place it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it shines on all those in the house.
\verse In the same way let your light shine before people, so that they can see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: The Law and the Prophets Fulfilled} “Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy them but to fulfill them.
\verse For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one tiny letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all takes place.
\verse Therefore whoever abolishes one of the least of these commandments and teaches people to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever keeps them and teaches them, this person will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
\verse For I say to you that unless your righteousness greatly surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven.
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: Anger Toward Others} “You have heard that it was said to the \textit{people of old}, ‘Do not commit murder,’ and ‘whoever commits murder will be subject to judgment.’
\verse But I say to you that everyone who is angry at his brother will be subject to judgment, and whoever says to his brother, ‘Stupid fool!’ will be subject to the council, and whoever says, ‘Obstinate fool!’ will be subject to fiery hell.
\verse Therefore if you present your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
\verse leave your gift there before the altar and first go be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your gift.
\verse \textit{Settle the case quickly with your accuser} while you are with him on the way, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
\verse Truly I say to you, you will never come out of there until you have paid back the last penny!
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: Adultery and Lust} “You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’
\verse But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
\verse And if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it from you! For it is better for you that one of your members be destroyed than your whole body be thrown into hell.
\verse And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it from you! For it is better for you that one of your limbs be destroyed than your whole body go into hell.
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: Divorce} “And it was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’
\verse But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for a matter of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: Taking Oaths} “Again you have heard that it was said to the \textit{people of old}, ‘Do not swear falsely, but fulfill your oaths to the Lord.’
\verse But I say to you, do not swear at all, either by heaven, because it is the throne of God,
\verse or by the earth, because it is the footstool of his feet, or by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great king.
\verse And do not swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.
\verse But let your statement be ‘Yes, yes; no, no,’ and anything beyond these is from the evil one.
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: Retaliation} “You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’
\verse But I say to you, do not resist the evildoer, but whoever strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to him also.
\verse And the one who wants to go to court with you and take your tunic, \textit{let him have} your outer garment also.
\verse And whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two.
\verse Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: Love for Enemies} “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor’ and ‘Hate your enemy.’
\verse But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
\verse in order that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven, because he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust.
\verse For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not the tax collectors also do the same?
\verse And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing that is remarkable? Do not the Gentiles also do the same?
\verse Therefore you be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.

\begin{biblechapter} % Matthew 6
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: Charitable Giving} “And take care not to practice your righteousness before people to be seen by them; \textit{otherwise} you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
\verse Therefore whenever you practice charitable giving, do not sound a trumpet in front of you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, in order that they may be praised by people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward in full!
\verse But you, when you practice charitable giving, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
\verse in order that your charitable giving may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: How to Pray} And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, in order that they may be seen by people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward in full!
\verse But whenever you pray, enter into your inner room and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
\verse “But when you pray, do not babble repetitiously like the pagans, for they think that because of their many words they will be heard.
\verse Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows \textit{what you need} before you ask him.
\verse Therefore you pray in this way:
\verse “Our Father who is in heaven, 
may your name be treated as holy.
\verse May your kingdom come, 
may your will be done 
on earth as it is in heaven.
\verse Give us today our daily bread,
\verse and forgive us our debts, 
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
\verse For if you forgive people their sins, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
\verse But if you do not forgive people, neither will your Father forgive your sins.
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: How to Fast} “Whenever you fast, do not be sullen like the hypocrites, for they make their faces unrecognizable in order that they may be seen fasting by people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward in full!
\verse But when you are fasting, \textit{put olive oil on your head} and wash your face
\verse so that you will not be seen by people as fasting, but to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: Treasure in Heaven} “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and consuming insect destroy and where thieves break in and steal,
\verse but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor consuming insect destroy and where thieves do not break in or steal.
\verse For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
\verse “The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore if your eye is sincere, your whole body will be full of light.
\verse But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. Therefore if the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
\verse “No one is able to serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You are not able to serve God and money.
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: Anxiety} “For this reason I say to you, do not be anxious for your life, what you will eat, and not for your body, what you will wear. Is your life not more than food and your body more than clothing?
\verse Consider the birds of the sky, that they do not sow or reap or gather produce into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are?
\verse And who among you, by being anxious, is able to add one hour to his life span?
\verse And why are you anxious about clothing? Observe the lilies of the field, how they grow: they do not toil or spin,
\verse but I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these.
\verse But if God dresses the grass of the field in this way, although it is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not do so much more for you, you of little faith?
\verse Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?,’
\verse for the pagans seek after all these things. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
\verse But seek first his kingdom and righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
\verse Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, because tomorrow will be anxious for itself. \textit{Each day has enough trouble of its own.}
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Matthew 7
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: On Judging Others} “Do not judge, so that you will not be judged.
\verse For by what judgment you judge, you will be judged, and by what measure you measure out, it will be measured out to you.
\verse And why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the beam of wood in your own eye?
\verse Or how will you say to your brother, ‘Allow me to remove the speck from your eye,’ and behold, the beam of wood is in your own eye?
\verse Hypocrite! First remove the beam of wood from your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye!
\verse “Do not give what is holy to dogs, or throw your pearls in front of pigs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn around and tear you to pieces.
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: Ask, Seek, Knock} “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened for you.
\verse For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.
\verse Or what man is there among you, if his son will ask him for bread, will give him a stone?
\verse Or also if he will ask for a fish, will give him a snake?
\verse Therefore if you, although you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?
\verse Therefore in all things, whatever you want that people should do to you, thus also you do to them. For this is the law and the prophets.
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: The Narrow Gate} “Enter through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it,
\verse because narrow is the gate and constricted is the road that leads to life, and there are few who find it!
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: Recognizing False Prophets} “Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inside are ravenous wolves.
\verse You will recognize them by their fruits: they do not gather grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles, do they?
\verse In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit.
\verse A good tree is not able to produce bad fruit, nor a bad tree to produce good fruit.
\verse Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
\verse As a result, you will recognize them by their fruits.
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: False Followers} “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
\verse On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many miracles in your name?’
\verse And then \textit{I will say to them plainly}, ‘I never knew you. Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness!’
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: Two Houses and Two Foundations} “Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
\verse And the rain came down and the rivers came and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it did not collapse, because its foundation was laid on the rock.
\verse And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
\verse And the rain came down and the rivers came and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it collapsed, and its fall was great.”
\verseWithHeading{The Sermon on the Mount: Response} And it happened when Jesus finished these words the crowds were amazed at his teaching,
\verse because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like their scribes.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Matthew 8
\verseWithHeading{A Leper Cleansed} And when he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.
\verse And behold, a leper approached and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”
\verse And extending his hand he touched him, saying, “I am willing, be clean.” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
\verse And Jesus said to him, “See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”
\verseWithHeading{A Centurion’s Slave Healed} Now when he entered Capernaum, a centurion approached him, appealing to him
\verse and saying, “Lord, my slave is lying paralyzed in my house, terribly tormented!”
\verse And he said to him, “I will come and heal him.”
\verse And the centurion answered and said, “Lord, I am not worthy that you should come in under my roof. But only say the word and my slave will be healed.
\verse For I also am a man under authority who has soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another one, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”
\verse Now when Jesus heard this, he was astonished, and said to those who were following him, “Truly I say to you, I have found such great faith with no one in Israel.
\verse But I say to you that many will come from east and west and \textit{be seated at the banquet} with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
\verse But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!”
\verse And Jesus said to the centurion, “Go, as you have believed it will be done for you.” And the slave was healed at that hour.
\verseWithHeading{Many at Capernaum Are Healed} And when Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying down and suffering with a fever.
\verse And he touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve him.
\verse Now when it was evening, they brought to him many who were demon-possessed, and he expelled the spirits with a word. And he healed all \textit{those who were sick},
\verse in order that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said, “He himself took away our sicknesses, 
and carried away our diseases.”
\verseWithHeading{Would-be Followers} Now when Jesus saw many crowds around him, he gave orders to depart to the other side.
\verse And a scribe approached and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go!”
\verse And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”
\verse And another of the disciples said to him, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”
\verse But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead!”
\verseWithHeading{Calming of a Storm} And as he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.
\verse And behold, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being inundated by the waves, but he himself was asleep.
\verse And they came and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”
\verse And he said to them, “Why are you fearful, you of little faith?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm.
\verse And the men were astonished, saying, “What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?”
\verseWithHeading{Demon-possessed Gadarenes Healed} And when he came to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from among the tombs met him, very violent, so that no one was able to pass by along that road.
\verse And behold, they cried out, saying, “\textit{What do you have to do with us}, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?”
\verse Now a long way from them a large herd of pigs was feeding.
\verse So the demons implored him, saying, “If you are going to expel us, send us into the herd of pigs.”
\verse And he said to them, “Go!” So they departed and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed headlong down the steep slope into the sea and drowned in the water.
\verse Now the herdsmen fled and went into the town and reported everything, including the things concerning the demon-possessed men.
\verse And behold, the whole town came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they implored him that he would depart from their region.

\verseWithHeading{A Paralytic Healed} And getting into a boat, he crossed over and came to his own town.
\verse And behold, they brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher, and when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Have courage, child, your sins are forgiven.”
\verse And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!”
\verse And knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts?
\verse For which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?
\verse But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” then he said to the paralytic, “Get up, pick up your stretcher and go to your home.”
\verse And he got up and went to his home.
\verse But when the crowds saw this, they were afraid and glorified God who had given such authority to men.
\verseWithHeading{Matthew Called to Follow Jesus} And as Jesus was going away from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth and said to him, “Follow me!” And he stood up and followed him.
\verse And it happened as he \textit{was dining} in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners were coming and \textit{dining} with Jesus and his disciples.
\verse And when they saw it, the Pharisees began to say to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
\verse And when he heard it, he said, “Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician, but those \textit{who are sick}.
\verse But go and learn what it means, “I want mercy and not sacrifice.” For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”
\verseWithHeading{On Fasting} Then the disciples of John approached him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”
\verse And Jesus said to them, “\textit{The bridegroom’s attendants} are not able to mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them. But days are coming when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.
\verse But no one puts a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment, for its patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear becomes worse.
\verse Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins. \textit{Otherwise} the wineskins burst and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are destroyed. But they put new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved.”
\verseWithHeading{A Woman Healed and a Daughter Raised} As he was saying these things to them, behold, one of the rulers came and knelt down before him, saying, “My daughter has just now died, but come, place your hand on her and she will live!”
\verse And Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him.
\verse And behold, a woman who had been suffering with a hemorrhage twelve years approached from behind and touched the edge of his cloak,
\verse for she said to herself, “If only I touch his cloak I will be healed.”
\verse But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, “Have courage, daughter! Your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed from that hour.
\verse And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the disorderly crowd,
\verse he said, “Go away, because the girl is not dead, but is sleeping.” And they ridiculed him.
\verse But when the crowd had been sent out, he entered and took her hand, and the girl got up.
\verse And this report went out into that whole region.
\verseWithHeading{Two Blind Men Healed} And as Jesus was going away from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
\verse And when he came into the house, the blind men approached him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.”
\verse Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith let it be done for you.”
\verse And their eyes were opened, and Jesus sternly warned them, saying, “See that no one finds out.”
\verse But they went out and spread the report about him in that whole region.
\verseWithHeading{A Demon Expelled} Now as they were going away, behold, they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was unable to speak.
\verse And after the demon had been expelled, the one who had been mute spoke, and the crowds were astonished, saying, “\textit{This has never been seen before} in Israel!”
\verse But the Pharisees were saying, “By the ruler of demons he expels the demons!”
\verseWithHeading{A Plentiful Harvest But Few Workers} And Jesus was going around all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness.
\verse And when he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were weary and dejected, like sheep that did not have a shepherd.
\verse Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
\verse Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest that he send out workers into his harvest.”

\verseWithHeading{The Twelve Commissioned and Sent Out} And summoning his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could expel them and could heal every disease and every sickness.
\verse Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,
\verse Philip, and Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus,
\verse Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot—the one who also betrayed him.
\verse Jesus sent out these twelve, instructing them saying, “Do not go on the road to the Gentiles, and do not enter into a city of the Samaritans,
\verse but go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\verse And as you are going, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near!’
\verse Heal those who are sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, expel demons. Freely you have received; freely give.
\verse Do not procure gold or silver or copper for your belts.
\verse Do not take a traveler’s bag for the road, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff, for the worker is deserving of his provisions.
\verse And into whatever town or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you depart.
\verse And when you enter into the house, greet it.
\verse And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
\verse And whoever does not welcome you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you are going out of that house or that town.
\verse Truly I say to you, it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town!
\verseWithHeading{Persecution of Disciples Predicted} “Behold, I am sending you out like sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
\verse But beware of people, because they will hand you over to councils, and they will flog you in their synagogues.
\verse And you will be brought before both governors and kings because of me, for a witness to them and to the Gentiles.
\verse But whenever they hand you over, do not be anxious how to speak or what you should say, for what you should say will be given to you at that hour.
\verse For you are not the ones who are speaking, but the Spirit of your Father who is speaking through you.
\verse “And brother will hand over brother to death, and a father his children, and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death,
\verse and you will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the one who endures to the end—this one will be saved.
\verse And whenever they persecute you in this town, flee to another, for truly I say to you, you will never finish going through the towns of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
\verse “A disciple is not superior to his teacher, nor a slave superior to his master.
\verse It is enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household?
\verseWithHeading{Fear God Rather Than People} “Therefore do not be afraid of them, because nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not become known.
\verse What I say to you in the dark, tell in the light, and what you hear in your ear, proclaim on the housetops.
\verse And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul, but instead be afraid of the one who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
\verse Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And one of them will not fall to the ground \textit{without the knowledge and consent} of your Father.
\verse And even the hairs of your head are all numbered!
\verse Therefore do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
\verse “Therefore everyone who acknowledges me before people, I also will acknowledge him before my Father who is in heaven.
\verse But whoever denies me before people, I also will deny him before my Father who is in heaven.
\verseWithHeading{Not Peace, But a Sword of Divisiveness} “Do not think that I have come to bring peace on the earth! I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
\verse For I have come to turn a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
\verse And the enemies of a man will be the members of his household.
\verse The one who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and the one who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
\verse And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
\verse The one who finds his life will lose it, and the one who loses his life because of me will find it.
\verseWithHeading{On Rewards} “The one who receives you receives me, and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me.
\verse The one who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and the one who receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive a righteous person’s reward.
\verse And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he will never lose his reward.”
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Matthew 11
\verseWithHeading{A Question from John the Baptist} And it happened that when Jesus had finished giving orders to his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and to preach in their towns.
\verse Now when John heard in prison the deeds of Christ, he sent word by his disciples
\verse and said to him, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?”
\verse And Jesus answered and said to them, “Go and tell John what you hear and see:
\verse the blind receive sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and the poor have good news announced to them.
\verse And whoever is not offended by me is blessed.”
\verse Now as these were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
\verse But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings.
\verse But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet!
\verse It is this man about whom it is written: ‘Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, 
who will prepare your way before you.’
\verse Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist. But the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
\verse But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven is treated violently, and the violent claim it.
\verse For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John,
\verse and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah, the one who is going to come.
\verse The one who has ears, let him hear!
\verse “But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to one another,
\verse saying, ‘We played the flute for you and you did not dance; 
we sang a lament and you did not mourn.’
\verse For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’
\verse The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a man who is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.”
\verseWithHeading{Woes Pronounced on Unrepentant Towns} Then he began to reproach the towns in which the majority of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent:
\verse “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
\verse Nevertheless I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and for Sidon on the day of judgment than for you!
\verse And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
\verse Nevertheless I tell you that it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you!”
\verseWithHeading{A Yoke That Is Easy} At that time Jesus answered and said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to young children.
\verse Yes, Father, for to do so \textit{was your gracious will}.
\verse All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and \textit{anyone to whom} the Son wants to reveal him.
\verse Come to me, all of you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.
\verse Take my yoke on you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
\verse For my yoke is easy to carry and my burden is light.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Matthew 12
\verseWithHeading{Plucking Grain on the Sabbath} At that time Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath. And his disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck off heads of grain and eat them.
\verse But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, “Behold, your disciples are doing what it is not permitted to do on the Sabbath!”
\verse So he said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those with him,
\verse how he entered into the house of God and ate the bread of the presentation, which it was not permitted for him or for those with him to eat, but only for the priests?
\verse Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the sanctity of the Sabbath and are guiltless?
\verse But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here!
\verse And if you had known what \textit{it means}, ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless.
\verse For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”
\verseWithHeading{A Man with a Withered Hand Healed} And going on from there he came into their synagogue.
\verse And behold, there was a man who had a withered hand, and they asked him, saying, “Is it permitted to heal on the Sabbath?” in order that they could accuse him.
\verse But he said to them, “What man will there be among you who will have one sheep and if this one fell into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?
\verse Then to what degree is a man worth more than a sheep? So then, it is permitted to do good on the Sabbath.”
\verse Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand,” and he stretched it out, and it was restored as healthy as the other one.
\verse But the Pharisees went out \textit{and plotted} against him in order that they could destroy him.
\verseWithHeading{God’s Chosen Servant} Now Jesus, when he learned of it, withdrew from there, and many followed him, and he healed them all.
\verse And he warned them that they should not \textit{reveal his identity},
\verse in order that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said,
\verse “Behold my servant whom I have chosen, 
my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased. 
I will put my Spirit on him, 
and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.
\verse He will not quarrel or cry out, 
nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.
\verse A crushed reed he will not break, 
and a smoldering wick he will not extinguish, 
until he brings justice to victory.
\verse And in his name the Gentiles will hope.
\verseWithHeading{A House Divided Cannot Stand} Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to him. And he healed him so that the man who was mute could speak and see.
\verse And all the crowds were amazed and began saying, “Perhaps this one is the Son of David!”
\verse But the Pharisees, when they heard it, said, “This man does not expel demons except by Beelzebul the ruler of demons!”
\verse But knowing their thoughts, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
\verse And if Satan expels Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
\verse And if I expel demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons expel them? For this reason they will be your judges!
\verse But if I expel demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you!
\verse Or how can someone enter into the house of a strong man and steal his property, unless he first ties up the strong man? And then he can thoroughly plunder his house.
\verse The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters.
\verse For this reason I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven!
\verse And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him either in this age or in the coming one!
\verseWithHeading{Good Trees and Good Fruit or Bad Trees and Bad Fruit} “Either make the tree good and its fruit is good, or make the tree bad and its fruit is bad, for the tree is known by its fruit.
\verse Offspring of vipers! How are you able to say good things when you are evil? For from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
\verse The good person from his good treasury brings out good things, and the evil person from his evil treasury brings out evil things.
\verse But I tell you that every worthless word that they speak, people will give an account for it on the day of judgment!
\verse For by your words you will be vindicated, and by your words you will be condemned.”
\verseWithHeading{The Sign of Jonah} Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him saying, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you!”
\verse But he answered and said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation desires a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah!
\verse For just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
\verse The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here!
\verse The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here!
\verseWithHeading{An Unclean Spirit Returns} “Now whenever an unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it travels through waterless places searching for rest, and does not find it.
\verse Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came out.’ And when it arrives it finds the house unoccupied and swept and put in order.
\verse Then it goes and brings along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there. And the last state of that person becomes worse than the first. So it will be for this evil generation also!”
\verseWithHeading{Jesus’ Mother and Brothers} And while he was still speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and brothers were standing there outside, desiring to speak to him.
\verse And someone told him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers are standing there outside desiring to speak to you.”
\verse But he answered and said to the one who told him, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”
\verse And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, “Behold my mother and my brothers!
\verse For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Matthew 13
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Sower} On that day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting by the sea.
\verse And large crowds gathered close around him, so that he got into a boat to sit down, and all the crowd was standing on the shore.
\verse And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, “Behold, the sower went out to sow,
\verse and while he was sowing, \textit{some seed} fell on the side of the path, and the birds came and devoured it.
\verse And other seed fell on the rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up at once because it did not have any depth of soil.
\verse But when the sun rose it was scorched, and because it did not have enough root, it withered.
\verse And other seed fell among the thorn plants, and the thorn plants came up and choked it.
\verse But other seed fell on the good soil and produced grain, this one a hundred times as much and this one sixty and this one thirty.
\verse The one who has ears, let him hear!”
\verseWithHeading{The Reason for the Parables} And the disciples came up and said to him, “\textit{Why} do you speak to them in parables?”
\verse And he answered and said to them, “To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to those people it has not been granted.
\verse For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
\verse For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand,
\verse and with reference to them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says,
\verse “\textit{You will listen carefully} and will never understand, 
and \textit{you will look closely} and will never perceive.
\verse But your eyes are blessed because they see, and your ears because they hear.
\verse For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it!
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Sower Interpreted} “You, therefore, listen to the parable of the sower:
\verse When anyone hears the word about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is what was sown on the side of the path.
\verse And what was sown on the rocky ground—this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.
\verse But he does not have a root in himself, but \textit{lasts only a little while}, and when affliction or persecution happens because of the word, immediately he falls away.
\verse And what was sown into the thorn plants—this is the one who hears the word, and the anxiety of this world and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word and it becomes unproductive.
\verse But what was sown on the good soil—this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces, this one a hundred times as much, and this one sixty, and this one thirty.”
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Weeds Among the Wheat} He put before them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field.
\verse But while his people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed darnel in the midst of the wheat and went away.
\verse So when the \textit{wheat} sprouted and yielded grain, then the darnel appeared also.
\verse So the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have darnel?’
\verse And he said to them, ‘An enemy has done this!’ So the slaves said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’
\verse But he said, “No, lest when you gather the darnel you uproot the wheat together with it.
\verse Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the season of the harvest I will tell the reapers, “First gather the darnel and tie it into bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my storehouse.” ’ ”
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Mustard Seed} He put before them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field.
\verse \textit{It} is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it is grown it is larger than the garden herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.”
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Yeast} He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and put into three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch was leavened.”
\verseWithHeading{Parables Fulfill Prophecy} Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables, and he was saying nothing to them without a parable,
\verse in order that what was spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled, who said, “I will open my mouth in parables; 
I will proclaim what has been hidden since the creation.”
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Weeds Interpreted} Then he left the crowds and came into the house, and his disciples came to him saying, “Explain the parable of the darnel in the field to us.”
\verse So he answered and said, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,
\verse and the field is the world. And the good seed—these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil one.
\verse And the enemy who sowed them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
\verse Thus just as the darnel is gathered and burned with fire, so it will be at the end of the age.
\verse The Son of Man will send out his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all the causes of sin and those who do lawless deeds,
\verse and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!
\verse Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The one who has ears, let him hear!
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Treasure Hidden in a Field} “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, that a man found and concealed, and in his joy he goes and sells everything that he has and buys that field.
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Valuable Pearl} “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.
\verse And when he found one very valuable pearl, he went and sold everything that he possessed and purchased it.
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Dragnet} “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind,
\verse which when it was filled they pulled to shore and sat down and collected the good fish into containers, but the bad they threw out.
\verse Thus it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go out and separate the evil from among the righteous
\verse and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!
\verse “Have you understood all these things?” They said to him, “Yes.”
\verse And he said to them, “For this reason every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of the house who brings out of his storeroom new things and old things.”
\verseWithHeading{Rejected at Nazareth} And it happened that when Jesus had finished these parables he went away from there.
\verse And he came to his hometown and began to teach them in their synagogue, so that they were amazed and said, “From where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles?
\verse Is not this one the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
\verse And are not all his sisters with us? From where then did this man get all these things?”
\verse And they were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own hometown and in his own household.”
\verse And he did not perform many miracles in that place because of their unbelief.

\verseWithHeading{Herod Kills John the Baptist} At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus
\verse and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist! He has been raised from the dead, and for this reason miraculous powers are at work in him.”
\verse For Herod, after arresting John, bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip,
\verse because John had been saying to him, “It is not permitted for you to have her.”
\verse And although he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they looked upon him as a prophet.
\verse But when Herod’s birthday celebration took place, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst of them and pleased Herod.
\verse Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
\verse And coached by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter!”
\verse And although the king was distressed, because of his oaths and his \textit{dinner guests} he commanded the request to be granted.
\verse And he sent orders and had John beheaded in the prison,
\verse and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
\verse And his disciples came and took away the corpse and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
\verseWithHeading{The Feeding of Five Thousand} Now when Jesus heard it, he withdrew from there in a boat to an isolated place by himself. And when the crowds heard it, they followed him by land from the towns.
\verse And as he got out, he saw the large crowd and had compassion on them and healed their sick.
\verse Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him saying, “The place is desolate and the hour \textit{is late}. Release the crowds so that they can go away into the villages and purchase food for themselves.”
\verse But Jesus said to them, “They do not \textit{need} to go away. You give them something to eat.”
\verse And they said to him, “We do not have anything here except five loaves and two fish.”
\verse So he said, “Bring them here to me.”
\verse And he commanded the crowds to recline for a meal on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks. And after breaking them, he gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
\verse And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.
\verse Now those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Walks on the Water} And immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent away the crowds.
\verse And after he sent away the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. So when evening came, he was there alone.
\verse But the boat was already many stadia distant from the land, being beaten by the waves, because the wind was against it.
\verse And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.
\verse But the disciples, when they saw him walking on the sea, were terrified, saying, “It is a ghost!” and they cried out in fear.
\verse But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Have courage, I am he! Do not be afraid!”
\verse And Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if \textit{it is you}, command me to come to you on the water!”
\verse So he said, “Come!” And getting out of the boat, Peter walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
\verse But when he saw the strong wind, he was afraid. And beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”
\verse And immediately Jesus extended his hand and caught him and said to him, “You of little faith! Why did you doubt?”
\verse And when they got into the boat, the wind abated.
\verse So those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God!”
\verseWithHeading{Many Healed at Gennesaret} And after they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.
\verse And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent word into that whole surrounding region, and they brought to him all those \textit{who were sick}.
\verse And they were imploring him that they might only touch the edge of his cloak, and all those who touched it were cured.

\verseWithHeading{Human Traditions and God’s Commandments} Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
\verse “Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat \textit{a meal}.”
\verse So he answered and said to them, “Why do you also break the commandment of God because of your tradition?
\verse For God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘The one who speaks evil of father or mother \textit{must certainly die}.’
\verse But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or his mother, “Whatever \textit{benefit you would have received} from me is a gift to God,”
\verse need not honor his father,’ and you make void the word of God for the sake of your tradition.
\verse Hypocrites! Isaiah correctly prophesied about you saying,
\verse ‘This people honors me with their lips, 
but their heart is far, far away from me,
\verse and they worship me in vain, 
teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’ ”
\verseWithHeading{Defilement from Within} And summoning the crowd, he said to them, “Hear and understand:
\verse It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth—this defiles a person.”
\verse Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”
\verse And he answered and said, “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.
\verse Let them! They are blind guides of the blind. And if the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”
\verse But Peter answered and said to him, “Explain this parable to us.”
\verse But he said, “Are you also still without understanding?
\verse Do you not understand that everything that enters into the mouth goes into the stomach and is evacuated into the latrine?
\verse But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these defile the person.
\verse For from the heart come evil plans, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, abusive speech.
\verse These are the things that defile a person. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person!”
\verseWithHeading{A Canaanite Woman’s Great Faith} And departing from there, Jesus went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
\verse And behold, a Canaanite woman from that district came and cried out, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”
\verse But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came up and asked him, saying, “Send her away, because she is crying out after us!”
\verse But he answered and said, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
\verse But she came and knelt down before him, saying, “Lord, help me!”
\verse And he answered and said, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs!”
\verse So she said, “Yes, Lord, for even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”
\verse Then Jesus answered and said to her, “O woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you want.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.
\verseWithHeading{Many Others Healed in Galilee} And departing from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee, and he went up on the mountain and was sitting there.
\verse And large crowds came to him, having with them the mute, blind, lame, crippled, and many others, and they put them down at his feet, and he healed them.
\verse So then the crowd was astonished when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel.
\verseWithHeading{The Feeding of Four Thousand} And Jesus summoned his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat, and I do not want to send them away hungry lest they give out on the way.”
\verse And the disciples said to him, “Where in this desolate place \textit{can we get} so much bread that such a great crowd could be satisfied?”
\verse And Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” So they said, “Seven, and a few little fish.”
\verse And commanding the crowd to recline for a meal on the ground,
\verse he took the seven loaves and the fish and after he had given thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
\verse And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.
\verse Now those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children.
\verse And after he sent away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.

\begin{biblechapter} % Matthew 16
\verseWithHeading{The Signs of the Times} And when the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test him, they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
\verse So he answered and said to them, “When evening comes you say, ‘It will be fair weather because the sky is red,’
\verse and early in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy weather, because the sky is red and darkening.’ You know how to evaluate correctly the appearance of the sky, but you are not able to evaluate the signs of the times.
\verse An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, and a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah!” And he left them and went away.
\verseWithHeading{Beware the Leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees} And when the disciples arrived at the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
\verse And Jesus said to them, “Watch out for and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”
\verse So they were discussing this among themselves, saying, “It is because we did not take bread.”
\verse But knowing this, Jesus said, “Why are you discussing among yourselves that you did not take bread, you of little faith?
\verse Do you not yet understand or do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
\verse Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you took up?
\verse How do you not understand that I did not speak to you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”
\verse Then they understood that he did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
\verseWithHeading{Peter’s Confession at Caesarea Philippi} Now when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea \textit{Philippi}, he began asking his disciples, saying, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”
\verse And they said, \textit{Some} say John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
\verse He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”
\verse And Simon Peter answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!”
\verse And Jesus answered and said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
\verse And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it!
\verse I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven.”
\verse Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was the Christ.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection} From that time on Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day.
\verse And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, \textit{God forbid}, Lord! This will never happen to you!”
\verse But he turned around and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a cause for stumbling to me, because you are not intent on the things of God, but the things of people!”
\verseWithHeading{Taking Up One’s Cross to Follow Jesus} Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
\verse For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of me will find it.
\verse For what will a person be benefited if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? Or what will a person give in exchange for his life?
\verse For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and at that time he will reward each one according to \textit{what he has done}.
\verse Truly I say to you, that there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Matthew 17
\verseWithHeading{The Transfiguration} And after six days Jesus took along Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves.
\verse And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothing became bright as the light.
\verse And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him.
\verse So Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good that we are here! If you want, I will make here three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
\verse While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!”
\verse And when the disciples heard this, they fell down on their faces and were extremely frightened.
\verse And Jesus came and touched them and said, “Get up and do not be afraid.”
\verse And when they lifted up their eyes they saw no one except him—Jesus alone.
\verse And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them saying, “Tell no one the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.”
\verse And the disciples asked him, saying, “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
\verse And he answered and said, “Elijah indeed is coming, and will restore all things.
\verse But I say to you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did with him whatever they wanted. In the same way also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.”
\verse Then the disciples understood that he had spoken to them about John the Baptist.
\verseWithHeading{A Demon-possessed Boy Healed} And when they came to the crowd, a man approached him, kneeling down before him
\verse and saying, “Lord, have mercy on my son, because he has seizures and suffers severely, for often he falls into the fire and often into the water.
\verse And I brought him to your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.”
\verse And Jesus answered and said, “O unbelieving and perverse generation! \textit{How long} will I be with you? \textit{How long} must I put up with you? Bring him here to me!”
\verse And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him and the boy was healed from that hour.
\verse Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and said, \textit{Why} were we not able to expel it?”
\verse And he said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly I say to you, if you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.”
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection a Second Time} Now as they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men,
\verse and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised.” And they were extremely distressed.
\verseWithHeading{Paying the Double Drachma Temple Tax} Now when they arrived in Capernaum, the ones who collected the double drachma tax came up to Peter and said, “Does your teacher not pay the double drachma tax?”
\verse He said, “Yes.” And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect tolls or taxes—from their own sons, or from foreigners?”
\verse And when he said, “From foreigners,” Jesus said to him, “Then the sons are free.
\verse But so that we do not give offense to them, go out to the sea, cast a line with a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a four-drachma coin. Take that and give it to them for me and you.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Matthew 18
\verseWithHeading{The Question About Who Is Greatest} At that time the disciples came up to Jesus, saying, “Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
\verse And calling a child to himself, he had him stand in their midst
\verse and said, “Truly I say to you, unless you turn around and become like young children, you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven!
\verse Therefore whoever humbles himself like this child, this person is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,
\verse and whoever welcomes one child such as this in my name welcomes me.
\verse But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him that \textit{a large millstone} be hung on his neck and he be drowned in the depths of the sea.
\verse Woe to the world because of causes for stumbling, for it is a necessity that causes for stumbling come; nevertheless, woe to the person through whom the cause for stumbling comes.
\verse And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it from you! It is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame than, having two hands or two feet, to be thrown into the eternal fire!
\verse And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it from you! It is better for you to enter into life one-eyed than, having two eyes, to be thrown into fiery hell!
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Lost Sheep} “See to it that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven constantly see the face of my Father who is in heaven.
\verse What do you think? If \textit{a certain man has} a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go and look for the one that wandered away?
\verse And if he happens to find it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not wander away.
\verse In the same way it is not the will \textit{of} your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish.
\verseWithHeading{Confronting a Brother Who Sins Against You} “Now if your brother sins against you, go correct him between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
\verse But if he does not listen, take with you in addition one or two others, so that by \textit{the testimony} of two or three witnesses every matter may be established.
\verse And if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. But if he refuses to listen to the church also, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
\verse “Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven.
\verse Again, truly I say to you that if two of you agree on earth about any matter that they ask, it will be done for them from my Father who is in heaven.
\verse For where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there in the midst of them.”
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Unforgiving Slave} Then Peter came up to him and said, “Lord, how many times will my brother sin against me and I will forgive him? Up to seven times?”
\verse Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven!
\verse “For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man—a king—who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.
\verse And when he began to settle them, someone was brought to him who owed ten thousand talents.
\verse And because he did not have enough to repay it, the master ordered him to be sold, and his wife and his children and everything that he had, and to be repaid.
\verse Then the slave threw himself to the ground and began to do obeisance to him, saying, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay back everything to you!’
\verse So the master of that slave, because he had compassion, released him and forgave him the loan.
\verse But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and taking hold of him, he began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back everything that you owe!’
\verse Then his fellow slave threw himself to the ground and began to implore him, saying, ‘Be patient with me and I will repay you!’
\verse But he did not want to, but rather he went and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed.
\verse So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were extremely distressed, and went and reported to their master everything that had happened.
\verse Then his master summoned him and said to him, ‘Wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you implored me!
\verse Should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave as I also showed mercy to you?’
\verse And because he was angry, his master handed him over to the merciless jailers until he would repay everything that was owed.
\verse So also my heavenly Father will do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from your hearts!”

\verseWithHeading{On Divorce} And it happened that when Jesus had finished these statements, he went away from Galilee and came into the region of Judea on the other side of the Jordan.
\verse And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
\verse And Pharisees came up to him in order to test him, and asked if it was permitted for a man to divorce his wife for any cause.
\verse And he answered and said, “Have you not read that the one who created them from the beginning made them male and female
\verse and said, ‘On account of this a man will leave his father and his mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’?
\verse So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, man must not separate.”
\verse They said to him, “Why then did Moses command us to give a document—a certificate of divorce—and to divorce her?”
\verse He said to them, “Moses, with reference to your hardness of heart, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not like this.
\verse Now I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the basis of sexual immorality, and marries another commits adultery, and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery.”
\verse The disciples said to him, “If this is the case of a man with his wife, it would be better not to marry!”
\verse But he said to them, “Not everyone can accept this saying but those to whom it has been given.
\verse For there are eunuchs who were born as such from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by people, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who is able to accept this, let him accept it.”
\verseWithHeading{Little Children Brought to Jesus} Then children were brought to him so that he could lay his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
\verse But Jesus said, “Allow the children, and do not forbid them to come to me, \textit{for to such belongs} the kingdom of heaven.”
\verse And he laid his hands on them and traveled on from there.
\verseWithHeading{A Rich Young Man} And behold, someone came up to him and said, “Teacher, what good thing must I do so that I will have eternal life?”
\verse And he said to him, “Why are you asking me about what is good? There is one who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments!”
\verse He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “Do not commit murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,
\verse honor your father and your mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.”
\verse The young man said to him, “All these I have observed. What do I still lack?”
\verse Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give the proceeds to the poor—and you will have treasure in heaven—and come, follow me.”
\verse But when the young man heard the statement, he went away sorrowful, because he was one who had many possessions.
\verse And Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I say to you that with difficulty a rich person will enter into the kingdom of heaven!
\verse And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich person into the kingdom of God.”
\verse So when the disciples heard this, they were extremely amazed, saying, “Then who can be saved?”
\verse But Jesus looked at them and said to them, “With human beings this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
\verse Then Peter answered and said to him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What then will there be for us?”
\verse And Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that in the renewal of the world, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me—you also will sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
\verse And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields on account of my name will receive a hundred times as much, and will inherit eternal life.
\verse But many who are first will be last, and the last first.

\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard} “For the kingdom of heaven is like a man—the master of the house—who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
\verse And after coming to an agreement with the workers for a denarius per day, he sent them into his vineyard.
\verse And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
\verse And to those people he said, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and I will give you whatever is right.’
\verse So they went. Going out again about the sixth and ninth hour he did the same thing.
\verse And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing there and said to them, ‘Why are you standing here the whole day unemployed?’
\verse They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go also into the vineyard.’
\verse And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last up to the first.’
\verse And when the ones hired about the eleventh hour came, they received a denarius apiece.
\verse And when the first came, they thought that they would receive more, and they also received a denarius apiece.
\verse And when they received it, they began to complain against the master of the house,
\verse saying, ‘These last people worked one hour and you made them equal to us who have endured the burden of the day and the burning heat!’
\verse But he answered one of them and said, ‘Friend, I am not doing you wrong. Did you not come to an agreement with me for a denarius?
\verse Take what is yours and go! But I want to give to this last person the same as I gave to you also.
\verse Is it not permitted for me to do whatever I want with what is mine? Or is your eye evil because I am generous?’
\verse Thus the last will be first and the first last.”
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection a Third Time} And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples by themselves and said to them on the way,
\verse “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death,
\verse and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock him and flog him and crucify him, and on the third day he will be raised.”
\verseWithHeading{A Request by the Mother of James and John} Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons, and kneeling down she asked something from him.
\verse And he said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Say that these two sons of mine may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your kingdom.”
\verse But Jesus answered and said, “You do not know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.”
\verse He said to them, “You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”
\verse And when the ten heard this, they were indignant concerning the two brothers.
\verse But Jesus called them to himself and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions exercise authority over them.
\verse It will not be like this among you! But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
\verse and whoever wants to be most prominent among you must be your slave—
\verse just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

\verse And the crowd rebuked them so that they would be quiet. But they called out all the more, saying, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
\verse And Jesus stopped, called them, and said, “What do you want me to do for you?”
\verse They said to him, “Lord, that our eyes be opened!”
\verse And having compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed him.

\verseWithHeading{The Triumphal Entry} And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
\verse saying to them, “Go into the village before you, and right away you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.
\verse And if anyone says anything to you, you will say, ‘The Lord \textit{needs them},’ and he will send them at once.”
\verse Now this took place so that what was spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled, saying,
\verse “Say to the daughter of Zion, 
‘Behold, your king is coming to you, 
humble and mounted on a donkey, 
and on a colt, the foal of a pack animal.’ ”
\verse So the disciples went and did just as Jesus directed them,
\verse and brought the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks on them, and he sat on them.
\verse And a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.
\verse And the crowds who went ahead of him and the ones who followed were shouting, saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David! 
Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! 
Hosanna in the highest heaven!”

\verseWithHeading{The Cleansing of the Temple} And Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those who were selling doves.
\verse And he said to them, “It is written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a cave of robbers!”
\verse And the blind and the lame came up to him in the temple courts and he healed them.
\verse But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children shouting in the temple courts and saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” they were indignant.
\verse And they said to him, “Do you hear what these children are saying?” So Jesus said to them, “Yes, have you never read, ‘Out of the mouths of children and nursing babies you have prepared for yourself praise’?”
\verse And leaving them, he went outside of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.
\verseWithHeading{A Barren Fig Tree Cursed} Now early in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry.
\verse And seeing a single fig tree by the road, he went to it and found nothing on it except leaves only. And he said to it, “May there be no more fruit from you \textit{forever}, and the fig tree withered at once.
\verse And when they saw it, the disciples were astonished, saying, “How did the fig tree wither at once?”
\verse And Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will do not only what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,” it will happen!
\verse And whatever you ask in prayer, if you believe, you will receive.”
\verseWithHeading{Jesus’ Authority Challenged} And after he arrived at the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him while he was teaching, saying, “By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?”
\verse And Jesus answered and said to them, “I also will ask you one question. If you tell the answer to me, I also will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
\verse From where was the baptism of John—from heaven or from men?” And they began to discuss this among themselves, saying, “If we say ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’
\verse But if we say, ‘From men,’ we are afraid of the crowd, because they all look upon John as a prophet.”
\verse And they answered and said to Jesus, “We do not know.” And he said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Two Sons} “Now what do you think? A man had two sons. He approached the first and said, ‘Son, go work in the vineyard today.’
\verse And he answered and said, ‘I do not want to!’ But later he changed his mind and went.
\verse And he approached the second and said the same thing. So he answered and said, ‘I will, sir,’ and he did not go.
\verse Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you into the kingdom of God!
\verse For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did believe him. And when you saw it, you did not even change your minds later so as to believe in him.
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Tenant Farmers in the Vineyard} “Listen to another parable: There was a man—a master of a house—who planted a vineyard, and put a fence around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower, and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey.
\verse And when the season of fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the tenant farmers to collect his fruit.
\verse And the tenant farmers seized his slaves, one of whom they beat, and one of whom they killed, and one of whom they stoned.
\verse Again, he sent other slaves, more than the first ones, and they did the same thing to them.
\verse So finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
\verse But when the tenant farmers saw the son, they said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance!’
\verse And they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
\verse Now when the master of the vineyard arrives, what will he do to those tenant farmers?”
\verse They said to him, “He will destroy those evil men completely and lease the vineyard to other tenant farmers who will give him the fruits in their season.”
\verse Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the scriptures, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, 
this has become \textit{the cornerstone}. 
This came about from the Lord, 
and it is marvelous in our eyes’?
\verse For this reason, I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a people who produce its fruits.
\verse And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls—it will crush him!”
\verse And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he was speaking about them,
\verse and although they wanted to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowds, because they looked upon him as a prophet.

\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Wedding Celebration} And continuing, Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying,
\verse “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man—a king—who gave a wedding celebration for his son.
\verse And he sent his slaves to summon those who had been invited to the wedding celebration, and they did not want to come.
\verse Again he sent other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding celebration!” ’
\verse But they paid no attention and went away—this one to his own field, that one to his business.
\verse And the others, seizing his slaves, mistreated them and killed them.
\verse And the king was angry and sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
\verse Then he said to his slaves, ‘The wedding celebration is ready, but those who had been invited were not worthy.
\verse Therefore, go out to the places where the roads exit the city and invite to the wedding celebration as many people as you find.’
\verse And those slaves went out into the roads and gathered everyone whom they found, both evil and good, and the wedding celebration was filled \textit{with dinner guests}.
\verse But when the king came in to see the \textit{dinner guests}, he saw a man there not dressed in wedding clothes.
\verse And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here, not having wedding clothes?’ But \textit{he could say nothing}.
\verse Then the king said to the servants, ‘Tie him up \textit{hand and foot} and throw him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!’
\verse For many are called but few are chosen.”
\verseWithHeading{Paying Taxes to Caesar} Then the Pharisees went \textit{and consulted} so that they could entrap him with a statement.
\verse And they sent their disciples to him with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and \textit{you do not care what anyone thinks}, \textit{because you do not regard the opinion of people}.
\verse Therefore tell us what you think. Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
\verse But because he knew their maliciousness, Jesus said, “Hypocrites! Why are you testing me?
\verse Show me the coin for the tax!” So they brought him a denarius.
\verse And he said to them, “Whose image and inscription is this?”
\verse They said to him, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!”
\verse And when they heard this, they were astonished, and they left him and went away.
\verseWithHeading{A Question About Marriage and the Resurrection} On that day Sadducees—who say there is no resurrection—came up to him and asked him,
\verse saying, “Teacher, Moses said if someone dies without having children, his brother is to marry his wife and \textit{father} descendants for his brother.
\verse Now there were seven brothers with us. And the first died after getting married, and because he did not have descendants, he left his wife to his brother.
\verse So also the second and the third, up to the seventh.
\verse And last of all the woman died.
\verse In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her as wife.”
\verse But Jesus answered and said to them, “You are mistaken, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God!
\verse For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven.
\verse Now concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, who said,
\verse “I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob”? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living!”
\verse And when the crowds heard this, they were amazed at his teaching.
\verseWithHeading{The Greatest Commandment} Now when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they assembled at the same place.
\verse And one of them, a legal expert, put a question to him to test him:
\verse “Teacher, which commandment is greatest in the law?”
\verse And he said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’
\verse This is the greatest and first commandment.
\verse And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’
\verse On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.”
\verseWithHeading{David’s Son and Lord} Now while the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,
\verse saying, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “David’s.”
\verse He said to them, “How then does David, by the Spirit, call him ‘Lord,’ saying,
\verse ‘The Lord said to my Lord, 
“Sit at my right hand 
until I put your enemies 
under your feet” ’?
\verse If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how is he his son?”
\verse And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask him any more questions.

\verseWithHeading{Seven Woes Pronounced on the Scribes and Pharisees} Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples,
\verse saying, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit on the seat of Moses.
\verse Therefore do and observe everything that they tell you, but do not do as \textit{they do}, for they tell others to do something and do not do it themselves.
\verse And they tie up heavy burdens and put them on people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing with their finger to move them.
\verse And they do all their deeds in order to be seen by people, for they make their phylacteries broad and make their tassels long.
\verse And they love the place of honor at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues
\verse and the greetings in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by people.
\verse But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ because one is your teacher, and you are all brothers,
\verse And do not call anyone your father on earth, for one is your heavenly Father.
\verse And do not be called teachers, because one is your teacher, the Christ.
\verse And the greatest among you will be your servant.
\verse And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
\verse “But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you shut the kingdom of heaven before people! For you do not enter, nor permit those wanting to go in to enter.
\verse “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you travel around the sea and the dry land to make one convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are!
\verse “Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing! But whoever swears by the gold of the temple is bound by his oath.’
\verse Fools and blind people! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy?
\verse And, ‘Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing! But whoever swears by the gift that is on it is bound by his oath.’
\verse Blind people! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy?
\verse Therefore the one who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything that is on it.
\verse And the one who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
\verse And the one who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by the one who sits on it.
\verse “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you pay a tenth of mint and dill and cumin, and neglect the more important matters of the law—justice and mercy and faithfulness! It was necessary to do these things \textit{while not neglecting those}.
\verse Blind guides who filter out a gnat and swallow a camel!
\verse “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence!
\verse Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside of it may become clean also.
\verse “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and of everything unclean!
\verse In the same way, on the outside you also appear righteous to people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
\verse “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous,
\verse and you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in the blood of the prophets!’
\verse Thus you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets!
\verse And you—fill up the measure of your fathers!
\verse Serpents! Offspring of vipers! How will you escape from the condemnation to hell?
\verse For this reason, behold, I am sending to you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and will pursue from town to town,
\verse so that upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on the earth from the blood of righteous Abel up to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
\verse Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation!
\verseWithHeading{The Lament over Jerusalem} “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How many times I wanted to gather your children together \textit{the way} a hen gathers her young together under her wings, and you were not willing!
\verse Behold, your house has been left to you desolate!

\verseWithHeading{The Destruction of the Temple Predicted} And as Jesus went out of the temple courts he was going along, and his disciples came up to point out to him the buildings of the temple.
\verse But he answered and said to them, “Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, not one stone will be left here on another stone that will not be thrown down!”
\verseWithHeading{Signs of the End of the Age} And as he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came up to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”
\verse And Jesus answered and said to them, “Watch out that no one deceives you!
\verse For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will deceive many.
\verse And you are going to hear about wars and rumors of wars. See to it that you are not alarmed, for this must happen, but the end is not yet.
\verse For nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
\verse But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.
\verseWithHeading{Persecution of Disciples Predicted} “Then they will hand you over to persecution and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of my name.
\verse And then many will be led into sin and will betray one another and will hate one another,
\verse and many false prophets will appear and will deceive many,
\verse and because lawlessness will increase, the love of many will grow cold.
\verse But the one who endures to the end—this person will be saved.
\verse And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.
\verseWithHeading{The Abomination of Desolation} “So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken about by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place” (let the one who reads understand),
\verse “then those in Judea must flee to the mountains!
\verse The one who is on his housetop must not come down to take things out of his house,
\verse and the one who is in the field must not turn back to pick up his cloak.
\verse And woe to those \textit{who are pregnant} and to those who are nursing their babies in those days!
\verse But pray that your flight may not happen in winter or on a Sabbath.
\verse For at that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not happened from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will happen.
\verse And unless those days had been shortened, \textit{no human being would be saved}. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened.
\verse “At that time if anyone should say to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or ‘Here he is,’ do not believe him!
\verse For false messiahs and false prophets will appear, and will produce great signs and wonders in order to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
\verse Behold, I have told you ahead of time!
\verse Therefore if they say to you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out, or ‘Behold, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it!
\verse For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so the coming of the Son of Man will be.
\verse Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.
\verseWithHeading{The Arrival of the Son of Man} “And immediately after the tribulation of those days, ‘the sun will be darkened 
and the moon will not give its light, 
and the stars will fall from heaven, 
and the powers of heaven will be shaken.’
\verse And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man arriving on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
\verse And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect together from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other end of it.
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Fig Tree} “Now learn the parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.
\verse So also you, when you see all these things, know that he is near, at the door.
\verse Truly I say to you that this generation will never pass away until all these things take place!
\verse Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
\verseWithHeading{The Unknown Day and Hour} “But concerning that day and hour no one knows—not even the angels of heaven nor the Son—except the Father alone.
\verse For just as the days of Noah were, so the coming of the Son of Man will be.
\verse For as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered into the ark.
\verse And they did not know anything until the deluge came and swept them all away. So also the coming of the Son of Man will be.
\verse Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one left.
\verse Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left.
\verse Therefore be on the alert, because you do not know what day your Lord is coming!
\verse But understand this: that if the master of the house had known what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into.
\verse For this reason you also must be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think he will come.

\verse But if that evil slave should say \textit{to himself}, ‘My master is staying away for a long time,’
\verse and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with drunkards,
\verse the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know,
\verse and will cut him in two and assign his place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!

\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Ten Virgins} “Then the kingdom of heaven may be compared to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
\verse Now five of them were foolish and five were wise.
\verse For when the foolish ones took their lamps, they did not take olive oil with them.
\verse But the wise ones took olive oil in flasks with their lamps.
\verse And when the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
\verse But in the middle of the night there was a shout, ‘Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’
\verse Then all those virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.
\verse And the foolish ones said to the wise ones, ‘Give us some of your olive oil, because our lamps are going out!’
\verse But the wise ones answered saying, “Certainly there will never be enough for us and for you! Go instead to those who sell olive oil and buy some for yourselves.’
\verse But while they had gone away to buy it the bridegroom arrived, and those who were ready went inside with him to the wedding celebration, and the door was shut.
\verse And later the other virgins came also, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open the door for us!’
\verse But he answered and said, ‘Truly I say to you, I do not know you!’
\verse Therefore be on the alert, because you do not know the day or the hour!
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Talents} For it is like a man going on a journey. He summoned his own slaves and handed over his property to them.
\verse And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each one according to his own ability, and he went on a journey immediately.
\verse The one who had received the five talents went out and traded with them and gained five more.
\verse In the same way the one who had the two gained two more.
\verse But the one who had received the one went away and dug up the ground and hid his master’s money.
\verse Now after a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.
\verse And the one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me five talents. See, I have gained five more talents!’
\verse His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things; I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’
\verse And the one who had the two talents also came up and said, ‘Master, you handed over to me two talents. See, I have gained two talents more!’
\verse His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things; I will put you in charge over many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’
\verse And the one who had received the one talent came up also and said, ‘Master, because I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering from where you did not scatter seed.
\verse And because I was afraid, I went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours!’
\verse But his master answered and said to him, ‘Evil and lazy slave! You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather from where I did not scatter seed.
\verse Then you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and when I returned I would have gotten back what was mine with interest!
\verse Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.
\verse For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
\verse And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness—in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!’
\verseWithHeading{The Judgment of the Sheep and the Goats} Now when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.
\verse And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them from one another like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
\verse And he will place the sheep on his right and the goats on the left.
\verse Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world!
\verse For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me as a guest,
\verse I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you cared for me, I was in prison and you came to me.’
\verse Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
\verse And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you as a guest, or naked and clothe you?
\verse And when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?’
\verse And the king will answer and say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, in as much as you did it to one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did it to me.’
\verse Then he will also say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you accursed ones, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels!
\verse For I was hungry and you did not give me anything to eat, I was thirsty and you did not give me anything to drink,
\verse I was a stranger and you did not welcome me as a guest, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not care for me.’
\verse Then they will also answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and not serve you?’
\verse Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly I say to you, in as much as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’

\verse Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas,
\verse and plotted in order that they could arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.
\verse But they were saying, “Not during the feast, so that there will not be an uproar among the people.”
\verseWithHeading{Jesus’ Anointing at Bethany} Now while Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,
\verse a woman came up to him holding an alabaster flask of very expensive perfumed oil, and poured it out on his head while he was reclining at table.
\verse And when the disciples saw it they were indignant, saying, “\textit{Why} this waste?
\verse For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor!”
\verse But Jesus, knowing this, said to them, “Why do you cause trouble for the woman? For she has done a good deed for me.
\verse For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.
\verse For when this woman poured this ointment on my body, she did it in order to prepare me for burial.
\verse Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her.”
\verseWithHeading{Judas Arranges to Betray Jesus} Then one of the twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
\verse and said, “What are you willing to give me if I in turn deliver him to you?” So they set out for him thirty silver coins.
\verse And from that time on, he began seeking a favorable opportunity in order that he could betray him.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus’ Final Passover with the Disciples} Now on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came up to Jesus, saying, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”
\verse And he said, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I am celebrating the Passover with you with my disciples.” ’
\verse And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
\verse And when it was evening, he was reclining at table with the twelve disciples.
\verse And while they were eating he said, “Truly I say to you, that one of you will betray me.”
\verse And greatly distressed, each one began to say to him, “\textit{Surely I am not he, am I}, Lord?”
\verse And he answered and said, “The one who dips his hand in the bowl with me—this one will betray me.
\verse The Son of Man is going just as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if that man had not been born.”
\verse And Judas, the one who was betraying him, answered and said, “\textit{Surely I am not he, am I}, Rabbi?” He said to him, “You have said it.”
\verseWithHeading{The Lord’s Supper} Now while they were eating Jesus took bread and, after giving thanks, he broke it, and giving it to the disciples, he said, “Take, eat, this is my body.”
\verse And after taking the cup and giving thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you,
\verse for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
\verse But I tell you, from now on I will never drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.”
\verse And after they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial} Then Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away because of me during this night, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd

\verse But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”
\verse But Peter answered and said to him, “If they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away!”
\verse Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you that during this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times!”
\verse Peter said to him, “Even if it is necessary for me to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the disciples said the same thing.
\verseWithHeading{The Prayer in Gethsemane} Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”
\verse And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be distressed and troubled.
\verse Then he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.”
\verse And going forward a little he fell down on his face, praying and saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”
\verse And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “So, were you not able to stay awake with me one hour?
\verse Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak!”
\verse Again for the second time he went away and prayed, saying, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will must be done.”
\verse And he came again and found them sleeping, \textit{for they could not keep their eyes open}.
\verse And leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same thing again.
\verse Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\verse Get up, let us go! Behold, the one who is betraying me is approaching!”
\verseWithHeading{The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus} And while he was still speaking, behold, Judas—one of the twelve—arrived, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
\verse Now the one who was betraying him had given them a sign, saying, “The one whom I kiss—he is the one. Arrest him!”
\verse And he came up to Jesus immediately and said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and kissed him.
\verse And Jesus said to him, “Friend, do that for which you have come.” Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.
\verse And behold, one of those with Jesus extended his hand and drew his sword, and striking the slave of the high priest, cut off his ear.
\verse Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place! For all who take up the sword will die by the sword.
\verse Or do you think that I cannot call upon my Father, and he would put at my disposal at once more than twelve legions of angels?
\verse How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must happen in this way?”
\verse At that time Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber, to arrest me? Every day in the temple courts I sat teaching, and you did not arrest me!
\verse But all this has happened in order that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then the disciples all abandoned him and fled.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Before the Sanhedrin} Now those who had arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
\verse But Peter was following him from a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And he went inside and was sitting with the officers to see the outcome.
\verse Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order that they could put him to death.
\verse And they did not find it, although many false witnesses came forward. And finally two came forward
\verse and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it within three days.’ ”
\verse And the high priest stood up and said to him, “Do you reply nothing? What are these people testifying against you?”
\verse But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, “I put you under oath by the living God, that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!”
\verse Jesus said to him, “You have said it. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
\verse Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have just now heard the blasphemy!
\verse What do you think?” And they answered and said, “\textit{He deserves death}!”
\verse Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists, and they slapped him,
\verse saying, “Prophesy for us, you Christ! Who is it who hit you?”
\verseWithHeading{Peter Denies Jesus Three Times} Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a female slave came up to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”
\verse But he denied it in the presence of them all, saying, “I do not know what you mean!”
\verse And when he went out to the gateway, another female slave saw him and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.”
\verse And again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man!”
\verse And after a little while those who were standing there came up and said to Peter, “You really are one of them also, because even your accent \textit{reveals who you are}.”
\verse Then he began to curse and to swear with an oath, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed.
\verse And Peter remembered the statement Jesus had said, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times,” and he went outside and wept bitterly.

\begin{biblechapter} % Matthew 27
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Taken to Pilate} Now when it was early morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus in order to put him to death.
\verse And after tying him up, they led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor.
\verseWithHeading{The Suicide of Judas Iscariot} Then when Judas, the one who had betrayed him, saw that he had been condemned, he regretted what he had done and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and elders,
\verse saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood!” But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it!”
\verse And throwing the silver coins into the temple he departed. And he went away and hanged himself.
\verse But the chief priests took the silver coins and said, “It is not permitted to put them into the temple treasury, because it is \textit{blood money}.”
\verse And after taking counsel, they purchased \textit{with} them the Potter’s Field, for a burial place for strangers.
\verse (For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood until today.)
\verse Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, who said, “And they took the thirty silver coins, the price of the one who had been priced, on whom a price had been set by the sons of Israel,
\verse and they gave them for the potter’s field, just as the Lord directed me.”
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Before Pilate} So Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the king of the Jews?” And Jesus said, “You say so.”
\verse And \textit{when he was being accused} by the chief priests and elders he answered nothing.
\verse Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?”
\verse And he did not reply to him, not even with reference to one statement, so that the governor was very astonished.
\verseWithHeading{Pilate Releases Barabbas} Now at each feast, the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd—the one whom they wanted.
\verse And at that time they had a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.
\verse So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you—Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?”
\verse (For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy.
\verse And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent a message to him, saying, “\textit{Have nothing to do with that righteous man}, for I have suffered much as a result of a dream today because of him.”)
\verse But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas and put Jesus to death.
\verse So the governor answered and said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas!”
\verse Pilate said to them, “What then should I do with Jesus, the one who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified!”
\verse And he said, “Why? What wrong has he done?” But they began to shout even louder, saying, “Let him be crucified!”
\verse So Pilate, when he saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but instead an uproar was developing, took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this man. You see to it!”
\verse And all the people answered and said, “His blood be on us and on our children!”
\verse Then he released Barabbas for them, but after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over so that he could be crucified.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Is Mocked} Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s residence and gathered the whole cohort to him.
\verse And they stripped him and put a scarlet military cloak around him,
\verse and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling down before him, they mocked him, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!”
\verse And they spat on him and took the reed and repeatedly struck him on his head.
\verse And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the military cloak and put his own clothes on him, and led him away in order to crucify him.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Is Crucified} And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene \textit{named} Simon. They forced this man to carry his cross.
\verse And when they came to a place called \textit{Golgotha} (which \textit{means Place of a Skull}),
\verse they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink, and when he tasted it he did not want to drink it.
\verse And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots.
\verse And they sat down and were watching over him there.
\verse And they put above his head the charge against him \textit{in writing}: “This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.”
\verse Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
\verse And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads
\verse and saying, “The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”
\verse In the same way also the chief priests, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking him, saying,
\verse “He saved others; he is not able to save himself! He is the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him!
\verse He trusts in God; let him deliver him now if he wants to, because he said, ‘I am the Son of God’!”
\verse And in the same way even the robbers who were crucified with him were reviling him.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Dies on the Cross} Now from the sixth hour, darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.
\verse And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “\textit{Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?}” (that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”)
\verse And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, said, “This man is summoning Elijah!”
\verse And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink.
\verse But the others said, “Leave him alone! let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.”
\verse And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.
\verse And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth shook and the rocks were split.
\verse And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,
\verse and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.
\verse Now the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that took place, were extremely frightened, saying, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”
\verse And there were many women there, observing from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him,
\verse among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Is Buried} Now when it was evening, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who also was a disciple of Jesus himself.
\verse This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
\verse And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
\verse and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a large stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.
\verse Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.
\verseWithHeading{The Tomb Is Sealed and Guarded} Now on the next day, which is after the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate,
\verse saying, “Sir, we remember that while that deceiver was still alive he said, ‘After three days I will rise.’
\verse Therefore give orders that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him and tell the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”
\verse Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you know how.”
\verse So they went with the guard of soldiers and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Matthew 28
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Is Raised} Now after the Sabbath, at the dawning on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to view the tomb.
\verse And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came up and rolled away the stone and sat down on it.
\verse Now his appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow.
\verse And the guards trembled from the fear of him and became like dead men.
\verse But the angel answered and said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
\verse He is not here, for he has been raised, just as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying.
\verse And go quickly, tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead, and behold, he is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there.’ Behold, I have told you.”
\verse And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
\verse And behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Greetings!” And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
\verse Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid! Go tell my brothers that they should go to Galilee, and there they will see me.”
\verseWithHeading{The Guards Report the Body Stolen} And while they were going, behold, some of the guard of soldiers went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
\verse And after they had assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a rather large sum of money to the soldiers,
\verse telling them, “Say ‘His disciples came during the night and stole him while we were sleeping.’
\verse And if this matter is heard before the governor, we will satisfy him and \textit{keep you out of trouble}.”
\verse So they took the money and did as they were told, and spread abroad this report among the Jews until this very day.
\verseWithHeading{The Great Commission} So the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated for them.
\verse And when they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted.
\verse And Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
\verse Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
\verse teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the age.”
