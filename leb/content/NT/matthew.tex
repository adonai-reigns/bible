\verse And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “So, were you not able to stay awake with me one hour?
\verse Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak!”
\verse Again for the second time he went away and\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “and” is supplied because the previous participle (“went away”) has been translated as a finite verb} prayed, saying, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will must be done.”

\verse And leaving them again, he went away and\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “and” is supplied because the previous participle (“went away”) has been translated as a finite verb} prayed for the third time, saying the same thing again.
\verse Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\verse Get up, let us go! Behold, the one who is betraying me is approaching!”
\verseWithHeading{The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus} And while\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “while” is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle (“was … speaking”)} he was still speaking, behold, Judas—one of the twelve—arrived, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.

\verse And he came up to Jesus immediately and\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “and” is supplied because the previous participle (“came up”) has been translated as a finite verb} said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and kissed him.
\verse And Jesus said to him, “Friend, do that\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*The words “do that” are not in the Greek text but are implied} for which you have come.”\lebnote{The meaning of this phrase is disputed: (1) some take it as a declarative (as in the translation); (2) others understand it as some form of a question, often with supplied words: (a) “Friend, are you misusing the kiss for that purpose for which you are here?” (b) “Friend, in connection with that for which you have appeared do you kiss me?” (c) “Friend, are you here for this purpose?” (d) “Friend, what are you here for?”; this last option, though often suggested, is doubtful because of lack of evidence for the relative pronoun used as an interrogative in direct questions} Then they came up and\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “and” is supplied because the previous participle (“came up”) has been translated as a finite verb} laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.
\verse And behold, one of those with Jesus extended his\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Literally “the”; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun} hand and\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “and” is supplied because the previous participle (“extended”) has been translated as a finite verb} drew his sword, and striking the slave of the high priest, cut off his ear.
\verse Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place! For all who take up the sword will die by the sword.
\verse Or do you think that I cannot call upon my Father, and he would put at my disposal at once more than twelve legions of angels?
\verse How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must happen in this way?”
\verse At that time Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber, to arrest me? Every day in the temple courts\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “courts” is supplied to distinguish this area from the interior of the temple building itself} I sat teaching, and you did not arrest me!
\verse But all this has happened in order that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then the disciples all abandoned him and\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “and” is supplied because the previous participle (“abandoned”) has been translated as a finite verb} fled.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Before the Sanhedrin} Now those who had arrested Jesus led him\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation} away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
\verse But Peter was following him from a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And he went inside and\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “and” is supplied because the previous participle (“went”) has been translated as a finite verb} was sitting with the officers to see the outcome.
\verse Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order that they could put him to death.

\verse And the high priest stood up and\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “and” is supplied because the previous participle (“stood up”) has been translated as a finite verb} said to him, “Do you reply nothing? What are these people testifying against you?”
\verse But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, “I put you under oath by the living God, that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!”
\verse Jesus said to him, “You have said it.\lebnote{:|NP|:*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation} But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power\lebnote{An indirect way of referring to God} and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
\verse Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have just now heard the blasphemy!
\verse What do you think?” And they answered and\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “and” is supplied because the previous participle (“answered”) has been translated as a finite verb} said, “\textit{He deserves death}!”\lebnote{Literally “he is deserving of death”}
\verse Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists, and they slapped him,\lebnote{:|NP|:*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation}
\verse saying, “Prophesy for us, you Christ! Who is it who hit you?”
\verseWithHeading{Peter Denies Jesus Three Times} Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a female slave came up to him and\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “and” is supplied because the previous participle (“came up”) has been translated as a finite verb} said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”
\verse But he denied it\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation} in the presence of them all, saying, “I do not know what you mean!”
\verse And when he\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “when” is supplied as a component of the participle (“went out”) which is understood as temporal} went out to the gateway, another female slave\lebnote{The words “female slave” are not in the Greek text but are implied by the feminine singular form} saw him and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.”
\verse And again he denied it\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation} with an oath, “I do not know the man!”
\verse And after a little while those who were standing there came up and\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “and” is supplied because the previous participle (“came up”) has been translated as a finite verb} said to Peter, “You really are one of them also, because even your accent \textit{reveals who you are}.”\lebnote{Literally “makes you evident”}
\verse Then he began to curse and to swear with an oath, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed.
\verse And Peter remembered the statement Jesus had said, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times,” and he went outside and\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “and” is supplied because the previous participle (“went”) has been translated as a finite verb} wept bitterly.

\verse Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?”
\verse And he did not reply to him, not even with reference to one statement, so that the governor was very astonished.
