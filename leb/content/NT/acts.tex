\verseWithHeading{The Preface}{I produced the former account, O Theophilus, about all \textit{that}\lebnote{“of what”}Jesus began to do and to teach,}%
\verse{until the day he was taken up, after hehad given orders through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen,}%
\verse{to whom he also presented himself alive after he suffered, with many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking the things about the kingdom of God.}%
\verse{And while hewas with\lebnote{Or “was assembling with,” or “was sharing a meal with”}them,he commanded them, “Do not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for what was promised by the Father, which you heard about from me.}%
\verse{For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit \textit{not many days from now}.”\lebnote{“not many days after these”}}%
\verseWithHeading{The Ascension}{So whenthey had come together, they began askinghim, saying, “Lord, is it at this time you are restoring the kingdom to Israel?”}%
\verse{But he said to them, “It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has set by his own authority.}%
\verse{But you will receive power whenthe Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the farthest part of the earth.”}%
\verse{And after hehad said these things, whilethey were watching, he was taken up, and a cloud received him from their sight.}%
\verse{And as they were staring into the sky whilehe was departing, behold, two men in white clothing stood by them}%
\verse{who also said, “Men \textit{of Galilee},\lebnote{“Galileans”}why do you stand there looking\lebnote{Some manuscripts have “gazing”}into the sky? This Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven like this will come back in the same way you saw him departing into heaven!”}%
\verseWithHeading{Matthias Chosen to Replace Judas}{Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain that is called Olive Grove\lebnote{This is a variation of the name “Mount of Olives”}which is near Jerusalem, \textit{a Sabbath day’s journey away}.\lebnote{“having a journey of a Sabbath”}}%
\verse{And when they had entered, they went up to the upstairs room where they were staying—Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas son of James.}%
\verse{All these were busily engaged with one mind in prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with\lebnote{Some manuscripts omit “with”}his brothers.}%
\verse{And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers (and it was a crowd of persons of about one hundred twenty at the same place) andsaid,}%
\verse{“Men and brothers, it was necessary that the scripture be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit proclaimed beforehand through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus,}%
\verse{because he was counted among us and received a share in this ministry.”}%
\verse{(Now this man acquired a field for the wages of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines spilled out.}%
\verse{And it became known to all who live in Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own language\lebnote{That is, Aramaic}“Akeldama,” that is, “Field of Blood.”)}%
\verse{“For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his residence become deserted, 
and let there be no one to live in it,’\lebnote{Ps 69:25} and, ‘Let another person take his position.’\lebnote{Ps 109:8}}%
\verse{Therefore it is necessary for one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,}%
\verse{beginning from the baptism of John until the day on which he was taken up from us—one of these men must become a witness of his resurrection together with us.”}%
\verse{And they proposed two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was called Justus) and Matthias.}%
\verse{And they prayed andsaid, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show clearly which one of these two you have chosen}%
\verse{to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to depart to his own place.”}%
\verse{And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was added to servewith the eleven apostles.}%

\verseWithHeading{Pentecost and the Coming of the Holy Spirit}{And when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in the same place.}%
\verse{And suddenly a sound like a violent rushing wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.}%
\verse{And divided\lebnote{Or perhaps “distributed”}tongues like fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.}%
\verse{And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages\lebnote{Or “tongues”}as the Spirit gave them ability to speak out.}%
\verse{Now there were Jews residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.}%
\verse{And whenthis sound occurred, the crowd gathered and was in confusion, because each one was hearing them speaking in his own language.}%
\verse{And they were astounded and astonished, saying, “Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?}%
\verse{And how do we hear, each one of us, in \textit{our own native language}?\lebnote{“our own language in which we were born”}}%
\verse{Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those residing in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,\lnOEE{}}%

\verse{But others jeered andsaid, “They are full of sweet new wine!”}%
\verseWithHeading{Peter’s Sermon on the Day of Pentecost}{But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them, “Judean men, and all those who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and pay attention to my words!}%
\verse{For these men are not drunk, as you assume, because it is the third hour of the day.}%
\verse{But this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:}%
\verse{‘And it will be in the last days,’ God says, 
‘I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, 
and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, 
and your young men will see visions, 
and your old men will dream dreams.}%
\verse{And even on my male slaves and on my female slaves 
I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.}%
\verse{And I will cause wonders in the heaven\lebnote{Or “sky”}above 
and signs on the earth below, 
blood and fire and vapor of smoke.}%
\verse{The sun will be changed to darkness

\verse{“Israelite men, listen to these words! Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, just as you yourselves know—}%
\verse{this man, delivered up by the determined plan and foreknowledge of God, you executed bynailing to a crossthrough the hand of lawless men.}%
\verse{God raised \textit{him}\lebnote{“whom”; it is necessary to specify “him” in the translation to avoid confusion with the “lawless men” in the previous verse}up, having brought to an end the pains of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.}%
\verse{For David says with reference to him,}%
\verse{‘I saw the Lord before me \textit{continually},\lebnote{“through everything”}
for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken.}%
\verse{For this reason my heart was glad 
and my tongue rejoiced greatly, 
furthermore also my flesh will live in hope,}%
\verse{because you will not abandon my soul in Hades, 
nor will you permit your Holy One to experience decay.}%
\verse{“Men and brothers, it is possible to speak with confidence to you about the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us until this day.}%
\verse{Therefore, because hewas a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat \textit{one of his descendants}\lebnote{“from the fruit of his loins”}on his throne,}%
\verse{byhaving foreseen this,he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ,\lnNKB{}that neither was he abandoned in Hades nor did his flesh experience decay.}%
\verse{This Jesus God raised up, of which\lebnote{Or “of whom,” referring to Jesus}we all are witnesses.}%
\verse{Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out this that you see and hear.\lebnote{Some manuscripts have “both see and hear”}}%
\verse{For David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says,}%
\verse{‘The Lord said to my Lord, 
“Sit at my right hand,}%
\verse{Therefore let all the house of Israel know beyond a doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified!”}%
\verseWithHeading{The Response to Peter’s Sermon}{Now when theyheard this,they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “What should we do, men and brothers?”}%
\verse{And Peter said\lebnote{Some manuscripts explicitly add “said”}to them, “Repent and be baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.}%
\verse{For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all those who are far away, as many as the Lord our God calls to himself.”}%

\verse{And they began sellingtheirpossessions and property, and distributing these things to all, to the degree that anyone had need.}%
\verse{And every day, devoting themselves to meetingwith one purpose in the temple courtsand breaking bread from house to house, they were eating their food with joy and simplicity of heart,}%

\verse{And leaping up, he stood and began walking aroundand entered into the temple courtswith them, walking and leaping and praising God.}%
\verse{And all the people saw him walking and praising God,}%
\verse{And they recognized him, that this one\lebnote{Some manuscripts have “that he himself”}was the one who used to sit asking for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with awe and astonishment at what had happened to him.}%

\verse{And on the basis of faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know, and the faith that is through him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all.}%
\verse{And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did also.}%
\verse{But the things which God foretold through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ\lnNKB{}would suffer, he has fulfilled in this way.}%
\verse{Therefore repent and turn back, so that your sins may be blotted out,}%
\verse{so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and he may send the Christ\lnNKB{}appointed for you—Jesus,}%
\verse{whom heaven must receive until the times of the restoration of all things, about which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times.}%
