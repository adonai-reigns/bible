\begin{biblechapter} % Acts 1
\verseWithHeading{The Preface}{I produced the former account, O Theophilus, about all \textit{that}\lebnote{“of what”} Jesus began to do and to teach,}%
\verse{until the day he was taken up, after he had given orders through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen,}%
\verse{to whom he also presented himself alive after he suffered, with many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking the things about the kingdom of God.}%
\verse{And while he was with\lebnote{Or “was assembling with,” or “was sharing a meal with”} them, he commanded them, “Do not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for what was promised by the Father, which you heard about from me.}%
\verse{For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit \textit{not many days from now}.”\lebnote{“not many days after these”}}%
\verseWithHeading{The Ascension}{So when they had come together, they began asking him, saying, “Lord, is it at this time you are restoring the kingdom to Israel?”}%
\verse{But he said to them, “It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has set by his own authority.}%
\verse{But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the farthest part of the earth.”}%
\verse{And after he had said these things, while they were watching, he was taken up, and a cloud received him from their sight.}%
\verse{And as they were staring into the sky while he was departing, behold, two men in white clothing stood by them}%
\verse{who also said, “Men \textit{of Galilee},\lebnote{“Galileans”} why do you stand there looking\lebnote{Some manuscripts have “gazing”} into the sky? This Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven like this will come back in the same way you saw him departing into heaven!”}%
\verseWithHeading{Matthias Chosen to Replace Judas}{Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain that is called Olive Grove\lebnote{This is a variation of the name “Mount of Olives”} which is near Jerusalem, \textit{a Sabbath day’s journey away}.\lebnote{“having a journey of a Sabbath”}}%
\verse{And when they had entered, they went up to the upstairs room where they were staying—Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas son of James.}%
\verse{All these were busily engaged with one mind in prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with\lebnote{Some manuscripts omit “with”} his brothers.}%
\verse{And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers (and it was a crowd of persons of about one hundred twenty at the same place) and said,}%
\verse{“Men and brothers, it was necessary that the scripture be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit proclaimed beforehand through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus,}%
\verse{because he was counted among us and received a share in this ministry.”}%
\verse{(Now this man acquired a field for the wages of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines spilled out.}%
\verse{And it became known to all who live in Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own language\lebnote{That is, Aramaic} “Akeldama,” that is, “Field of Blood.”)}%
\verse{“For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his residence become deserted, 
and let there be no one to live in it,’\lebnote{Ps 69:25} and, ‘Let another person take his position.’\lebnote{Ps 109:8}}%
\verse{Therefore it is necessary for one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,}%
\verse{beginning from the baptism of John until the day on which he was taken up from us—one of these men must become a witness of his resurrection together with us.”}%
\verse{And they proposed two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was called Justus) and Matthias.}%
\verse{And they prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show clearly which one of these two you have chosen}%
\verse{to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to depart to his own place.”}%
\verse{And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was added to serve with the eleven apostles.}%

\begin{biblechapter} % Acts 2
\verseWithHeading{Pentecost and the Coming of the Holy Spirit}{And when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in the same place.}%
\verse{And suddenly a sound like a violent rushing wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.}%
\verse{And divided\lebnote{Or perhaps “distributed”} tongues like fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.}%
\verse{And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages\lebnote{Or “tongues”} as the Spirit gave them ability to speak out.}%
\verse{Now there were Jews residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.}%
\verse{And when this sound occurred, the crowd gathered and was in confusion, because each one was hearing them speaking in his own language.}%
\verse{And they were astounded and astonished, saying, “Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?}%
\verse{And how do we hear, each one of us, in \textit{our own native language}?\lebnote{“our own language in which we were born”}}%
\verse{Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those residing in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,\lnOEE{}}%
\verse{Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya toward Cyrene, and the Romans who were in town,}%
\verse{both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs—we hear them speaking in our own languages the great deeds of God!”}%
\verse{And all were amazed and greatly perplexed, saying \textit{to one another},\lebnote{“one to the other”} “\textit{What can this mean?}”\lebnote{“what does this want to be”}}%
\verse{But others jeered and said, “They are full of sweet new wine!”}%
\verseWithHeading{Peter’s Sermon on the Day of Pentecost}{But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them, “Judean men, and all those who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and pay attention to my words!}%
\verse{For these men are not drunk, as you assume, because it is the third hour of the day.}%
\verse{But this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:}%
\verse{‘And it will be in the last days,’ God says, 
‘I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, 
and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, 
and your young men will see visions, 
and your old men will dream dreams.}%
\verse{And even on my male slaves and on my female slaves 
I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.}%
\verse{And I will cause wonders in the heaven\lebnote{Or “sky”} above 
and signs on the earth below, 
blood and fire and vapor of smoke.}%
\verse{The sun will be changed to darkness 
and the moon to blood, 
before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.}%
\verse{And it will be that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.’\lebnote{Joel 2:28–32}}%
\verse{“Israelite men, listen to these words! Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, just as you yourselves know—}%
\verse{this man, delivered up by the determined plan and foreknowledge of God, you executed by nailing to a cross through the hand of lawless men.}%
\verse{God raised \textit{him}\lebnote{“whom”; it is necessary to specify “him” in the translation to avoid confusion with the “lawless men” in the previous verse} up, having brought to an end the pains of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.}%
\verse{For David says with reference to him,}%
\verse{‘I saw the Lord before me \textit{continually},\lebnote{“through everything”} 
for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken.}%
\verse{For this reason my heart was glad 
and my tongue rejoiced greatly, 
furthermore also my flesh will live in hope,}%
\verse{because you will not abandon my soul in Hades, 
nor will you permit your Holy One to experience decay.}%
\verse{“Men and brothers, it is possible to speak with confidence to you about the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us until this day.}%
\verse{Therefore, because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat \textit{one of his descendants}\lebnote{“from the fruit of his loins”} on his throne,}%
\verse{by having foreseen this, he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ,\lnNKB{} that neither was he abandoned in Hades nor did his flesh experience decay.}%
\verse{This Jesus God raised up, of which\lebnote{Or “of whom,” referring to Jesus} we all are witnesses.}%
\verse{Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out this that you see and hear.\lebnote{Some manuscripts have “both see and hear”}}%
\verse{For David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says,}%
\verse{‘The Lord said to my Lord, 
“Sit at my right hand,}%
\verse{Therefore let all the house of Israel know beyond a doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified!”}%
\verseWithHeading{The Response to Peter’s Sermon}{Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “What should we do, men and brothers?”}%
\verse{And Peter said\lebnote{Some manuscripts explicitly add “said”} to them, “Repent and be baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.}%
\verse{For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all those who are far away, as many as the Lord our God calls to himself.”}%
\verse{And with many other words he solemnly urged and exhorted them, saying, “Be saved from this crooked generation!”}%
\verse{So those who accepted his message were baptized, and on that day about three thousand souls were added.}%
\verseWithHeading{The Fellowship of the First Believers}{And they were devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayers.}%
\verse{And fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were being performed by the apostles.}%
\verse{And all who believed were in the same place, and had everything in common.}%
\verse{And they began selling their possessions and property, and distributing these things to all, to the degree that anyone had need.}%
\verse{And every day, devoting themselves to meeting with one purpose in the temple courts and breaking bread from house to house, they were eating their food with joy and simplicity of heart,}%
\verse{praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding every day to the total of those who were being saved.}%

\begin{biblechapter} % Acts 3
\verseWithHeading{A Lame Beggar Healed at the Temple}{Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.}%
\verse{And a certain man was being carried who was lame \textit{from birth}.\lebnote{“from his mother’s womb”} \textit{He}\lebnote{“who,” but a new sentence was begun here in the translation in keeping with English style} was placed every day at the gate of the temple called “Beautiful,” so that he could ask for charitable gifts from those who were going into the temple courts.}%
\verse{When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple courts, he began asking to receive alms.}%
\verse{And Peter looked intently at him, together with John, and said, “Look at us!”}%
\verse{So he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them.}%
\verse{But Peter said, “Silver and gold \textit{I do not possess},\lebnote{“is not to me”} but what I have, this I give to you—in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, walk!”\lebnote{Some manuscripts have “get up and walk”}}%
\verse{And taking hold of him by the right hand, he raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong.}%
\verse{And leaping up, he stood and began walking around and entered into the temple courts with them, walking and leaping and praising God.}%
\verse{And all the people saw him walking and praising God,}%
\verse{And they recognized him, that this one\lebnote{Some manuscripts have “that he himself”} was the one who used to sit asking for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with awe and astonishment at what had happened to him.}%
\verseWithHeading{Peter’s Sermon in Solomon’s Portico}{And while he was holding fast to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon’s, utterly astonished.}%
\verse{And when he saw it, Peter replied to the people, “Men and Israelites, why are you astonished at this? Or why are you staring at us, as if by our own power or godliness we have made him walk?}%
\verse{The God of Abraham and of Isaac\lebnote{Some manuscripts have “the God of Isaac”} and of Jacob,\lebnote{Some manuscripts have “the God of Jacob”} the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and denied in the presence of Pilate, after\lebnote{Or “although”; this genitive absolute construction can be understood as either temporal “after” or concessive “although”} he had decided to release him.}%
\verse{But you denied the Holy and Righteous One and demanded that a man—a murderer—be granted to you.}%
\verse{And you killed the originator of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses!}%
\verse{And on the basis of faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know, and the faith that is through him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all.}%
\verse{And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did also.}%
\verse{But the things which God foretold through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ\lnNKB{} would suffer, he has fulfilled in this way.}%
\verse{Therefore repent and turn back, so that your sins may be blotted out,}%
\verse{so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and he may send the Christ\lnNKB{} appointed for you—Jesus,}%
\verse{whom heaven must receive until the times of the restoration of all things, about which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times.}%
\verse{Moses said, ‘The Lord God\lebnote{Some manuscripts have “The Lord your God”} will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You will listen to him in everything that he says to you.\lebnote{Deut 18:15}}%
\verse{And it will be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet will be destroyed utterly from the people.’\lebnote{Deut 18:19 and Lev 23:29}}%
\verse{And indeed, all the prophets from Samuel and all those who followed him have spoken about and proclaimed these days.}%
\verse{You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God ordained with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed.’\lebnote{Gen 22:18}}%
\verse{God, after he had raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning each of you back from your wickedness!”}%

\begin{biblechapter} % Acts 4
\verseWithHeading{Peter and John Arrested}{And while they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees approached them,}%
\verse{greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.}%
\verse{And they laid hands on them and put them in custody until the next day, because it was already evening.}%
\verse{But many of those who listened to the message believed, and the number of the men was approximately five thousand.}%
\verseWithHeading{Peter and John on Trial Before the Sanhedrin}{And it happened that on the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes came together in Jerusalem,}%
\verse{and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all those who were from the high priest’s family.}%
\verse{And they made them stand in their midst and began to ask, “By what power or by what name did you do this?”}%
\verse{Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders,}%
\verse{if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a sick man—by what means\lebnote{Or “through whom”} this man was healed—}%
\verse{let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead—by him this man stands before you healthy!}%
\verse{This one\lebnote{“This one” refers to Jesus} is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, that has become \textit{the cornerstone}.\lebnote{“the head of the corner”; this verse is an allusion to Ps 118:22}}%
\verse{And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven that is given among people by which we must be saved.”}%
\verse{Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were astonished, and recognized them, that they had been with Jesus.}%
\verse{And because they saw the man who had been healed standing there with them, they had nothing to say in return.}%
\verse{But after they had ordered them to go outside the Sanhedrin,\lnNVQ{} they began to confer with one another,}%
\verse{saying, “What should we do with these men? For that a remarkable sign has taken place through them is evident to all those who live in Jerusalem, and we are not able to deny it!}%
\verse{But in order that it may not spread much further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more in this name \textit{to anyone at all}.”\lebnote{“to no man”}}%
\verse{And they called them back and commanded them not to speak or to teach at all in the name of Jesus.}%
\verse{But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than God, you decide!}%
\verse{For we are not able to refrain from speaking about the things that we have seen and heard.”}%
\verse{So after threatening them further, they released them, finding no way to punish them on account of the people, because they were all praising God for what had happened.}%
\verse{For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.}%
\verseWithHeading{The Believers Pray for Continued Bold Witness}{And when they were released, they went to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.}%
\verse{And when they heard it, they lifted their voices with one mind to God and said, “Master, you are the one who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them,}%
\verse{the one who said by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of our father David, your servant,}%
\verse{‘Why do the nations\lnMXZ{} rage, 
and the peoples conspire in vain?}%
\verse{For in truth both Herod and Pontius Pilate, together with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, assembled together in this city against your holy servant Jesus whom you anointed,}%
\verse{to do all that your hand and plan\lebnote{Some manuscripts have “and your plan”} had predestined to take place.}%
\verse{And now, Lord, concern yourself with their threats and grant your slaves to speak your message with all boldness,}%
\verse{as you extend your hand to heal and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”}%
\verse{And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word\lebnote{Or “message”} of God with boldness.}%
\verseWithHeading{The Believers Share All Things in Common}{Now the group of those who believed were one heart and soul, and no one said anything of what belonged to him was his own, but all things were theirs in common.}%
\verse{And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was on them all.}%
\verse{For there was not even anyone needy among them, because all those who were owners of plots of land or houses were selling them and bringing the proceeds of the things that were sold}%
\verse{and placing them at the feet of the apostles. And it was being distributed to each as anyone had need.}%
\verse{So Joseph, who was called Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated “son of encouragement”), a Levite of Cyprus by nationality,}%
\verse{sold a field\lebnote{Or “a farm”} that belonged to him and brought the money and placed it at the feet of the apostles.}%

\verseWithHeading{Ananias and Sapphira Lie to the Holy Spirit}{Now a certain man \textit{named}\lnNBN{} Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,}%

\verse{But Peter said, “Ananias, for what reason has Satan filled your heart, that you lied to the Holy Spirit and kept back for yourself some of the proceeds of the piece of land?}%
\verse{When it remained to you, did it not remain yours? And when it was sold, was it at your disposal? How is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to people, but to God!”}%
\verse{And when Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear came on all those who heard about it.}%

\verseWithHeading{Many Signs and Wonders Are Performed by the Apostles}{Now many signs and wonders were being performed among the people through the hands of the apostles. And they were all together\lebnote{Or perhaps “by common consent”} in Solomon’s Portico.}%
\verse{And none of the rest dared to join them, but the people spoke highly of them.}%
\verse{And even more believers in the Lord\lebnote{Or “even more believers were being added to the Lord”} were being added, large numbers of both men and women,}%
\verse{so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and put them on cots and mats\lebnote{Or “mattresses”} so that when Peter came by, at least his shadow would fall on some of them.}%
\verse{And the people of the towns around Jerusalem also came together, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, who were all being healed.}%
\verseWithHeading{The Apostles Arrested and Imprisoned}{Now the high priest rose up and all those who were with him (that is, the party of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy.}%

\verse{“Go and stand in the temple courts and proclaim to the people all the words of this life.”}%
\verse{And when they heard this, they entered at daybreak into the temple courts and began teaching.}%
\verse{Now when the high priest and those with him arrived, they summoned the Sanhedrin—even the whole council of elders of the sons of Israel—and sent to the prison to have them brought.}%
\verse{But the officers who came\lebnote{Or “when they came”} did not find them in the prison, and they returned and reported,}%
\verse{saying, “We found the prison locked with all security and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside!”}%
\verse{Now when both the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed concerning them, as to what this might be.}%

\verseWithHeading{The Apostles on Trial Before the Sanhedrin}{And when they had brought them, they made them stand in the Sanhedrin,\lnNVQ{} and the high priest put a question to them,}%

\verse{The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree.}%
\verse{This one God has exalted to his right hand as Leader and Savior to grant repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.}%
\verse{And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.”}%
\verse{Now when they heard this, they were infuriated, and were wanting to execute them.}%
\verse{But a certain man stood up in the Sanhedrin,\lnNVQ{} a Pharisee \textit{named}\lnNBN{} Gamaliel, a teacher of the law respected by all the people, and gave orders to put the men outside for a short time.}%
\verse{And he said to them, “Men and Israelites, take care for yourselves what you are about to do to these men!}%
\verse{For before these days, Theudas rose up saying he was somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined \textit{him}.\lebnote{“to whom”} \textit{He}\lebnote{“who”} was executed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.}%

\verse{And even some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him, and some were saying, “What does this babbler want to say?” But others said, “He appears to be a proclaimer of foreign deities,” because he was proclaiming the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.}%

\verse{the God who made the world and all the things in it. This one, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by human hands,}%

\verse{to search for God, if perhaps indeed they might feel around for him and find him. And indeed he is not far away from each one of us,}%
\verse{for in him we live and move and exist,\lebnote{Some interpreters hold that the phrase “in him we live and move and exist” is a quotation from Epimenides of Crete, but more likely it is a traditional Greek formula} as even some of \textit{your own}\lebnote{“with respect to you”} poets have said: ‘For we also are \textit{his}\lebnote{“of him”} offspring.’\lebnote{Aratus, \textit{Phaenomena} 5}}%

\verse{Why is it thought incredible by you people that God raises the dead?}%
\verse{Indeed, I myself thought it was necessary to do many things opposed to the name of Jesus the Nazarene,}%
\verse{which I also did in Jerusalem, and not only did I lock up many of the saints in prison, having received authority from the chief priests, but also when they were being executed, I cast my vote\lebnote{“voting pebble,” but here “vote” rather than “voting pebble” is used in the translation to avoid the idea that this small stone was actually thrown at the accused (it was used as a method of voting)} against them.}%
\verse{And throughout all the synagogues I punished them often and tried to force them to blaspheme, and because I was enraged at them beyond measure, I was pursuing them even as far as to foreign cities.}%

\verse{“Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,}%
\verse{but to those in Damascus first, and in Jerusalem and all the region of Judea and to the Gentiles, I proclaimed that they should repent and turn to God, doing deeds worthy of repentance.}%
\verse{On account of these things the Jews seized me in\lebnote{Some manuscripts have “while I was in”} the temple courts and were attempting to kill me.}%
\verse{Therefore I have experienced help from God until this day, and I stand here testifying to both small and great, saying nothing except what both the prophets and Moses have said were going to happen,}%

\verse{And when we entered into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who was guarding him.}%
\verseWithHeading{Paul and the Jewish Community in Rome}{Now it happened that after three days, he called together those who were the most prominent of the Jews. And when they had assembled, he said to them, “Men and brothers, although I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, from Jerusalem I was delivered as a prisoner into the hands of the Romans,}%
\verse{who, when they had examined me, were wanting to release me, because there was no basis for an accusation worthy of death with me.}%
\verse{But because the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar (not as if I had any charge to bring against my own people).\lebnote{Or “nation”}}%
\verse{Therefore for this reason I have requested to see you and to speak with you, for because of the hope of Israel I am wearing this chain!”}%
\verse{And they said to him, “We have received no letters about you from Judea, nor has any of the brothers come and reported or spoken anything evil about you.}%
\verse{But we would like to hear from you what you think, for concerning this sect it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.”}%
\verse{And when they had set a day with him, many more came to him at his lodging place, to whom he was explaining from early in the morning until evening, testifying about the kingdom of God and attempting to convince them about Jesus from both the law of Moses and the prophets.}%
\verse{And some were convinced by what was said, but others refused to believe.}%
\verse{So being in disagreement with one another, they began to leave after Paul made one statement: “The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through the prophet Isaiah to your fathers,}%
\verse{saying,}%
\verse{‘Go to this people and say, 
“\textit{You will keep on hearing}\lebnote{“hearing you will hear”} and will never understand, 
and \textit{you will keep on seeing}\lebnote{“seeing you will see”} and will never perceive.}%
\verse{Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles. They also will listen!”\lebnote{Some later manuscripts include v. 29: “And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.”}}%
\verse{So he stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and welcomed all who came to him,}%
\verse{proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.}%
