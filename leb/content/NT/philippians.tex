\begin{biblechapter} % Philippians 1
\verseWithHeading{Greeting} Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons.
\verse Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\verseWithHeading{Thanksgiving} I give thanks to my God upon my every remembrance of you,
\verse always in my every prayer for all of you, making the prayer with joy,
\verse because of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now,
\verse convinced of this same \textit{thing}, that the one who began a good work in you will finish \textit{it} until the day of Christ Jesus,
\verse just as it is right for me to think this about all of you, because I have you in my heart, \textit{since} both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel all of you are sharers of grace with me.
\verse For God \textit{is} my witness, that I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
\verseWithHeading{Prayer for Spiritual Maturity} And this I pray: that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment,
\verse so that you may approve what is superior, in order that you may be sincere and blameless in the day of Christ,
\verse having been filled \textit{with the} fruit of righteousness which \textit{comes} through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.
\verseWithHeading{The Progress of the Gospel} Now I want you to know, brothers, that \textit{my circumstances} have happened instead for the progress of the gospel,
\verse so that my imprisonment in Christ has become known in the whole praetorium and to all the rest,
\verse and most of the brothers, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, dare \textit{even} more to speak the word without fear.
\verse Some even because of envy and strife preach Christ, but some also because of good will.
\verse The latter \textit{do so} from love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.
\verse The former proclaim Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction in my imprisonment.
\verse \textit{What is the result?} Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice. But also I will rejoice,
\verse for I know that this will turn out to me for deliverance through your prayer and the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
\verse according to my eager expectation and hope, that I will be put to shame in nothing, but with all boldness, even now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether through life or through death.
\verse For to me to live \textit{is} Christ and to die \textit{is} gain.
\verse But if \textit{it is} to live in the flesh, this \textit{is} fruitful work for me, and which I will prefer \textit{I do} not know.
\verse But I am hard pressed \textit{between the two options}, having the desire to depart and to be with Christ, \textit{for this is very much better}.
\verse But to stay on in the flesh \textit{is} more necessary for your sake.
\verse And because I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,
\verse so that \textit{what} you can be proud of may increase in Christ Jesus because of me through my return again to you.
\verseWithHeading{Stand Firm for the Gospel} Only lead your lives in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent I hear \textit{your circumstances}, that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one soul contending side by side for the faith of the gospel,
\verse and not letting yourselves be intimidated in anything by your opponents, which is a sign of destruction to them, but of your salvation, and this from God,
\verse because to you has been graciously granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on behalf of him,
\verse having the same struggle which you saw in me and now hear about in me.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Philippians 2
\verseWithHeading{Humility and Unity} Therefore, if \textit{there is} any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,
\verse complete my joy, so that \textit{you are in agreement}, having the same love, united in spirit, \textit{having one purpose}.
\verse \textit{Do} nothing according to selfish ambition or according to empty conceit, but in humility considering one another better than yourselves,
\verse each of you not looking out for \textit{your own interests}, but also each of you \textit{for} \textit{the interests} of others.
\verseWithHeading{Christ’s Humiliation and Exaltation} Think this in yourselves which \textit{was} also in Christ Jesus,
\verse who, existing in the form of God, 
did not consider being equal with God something to be grasped,
\verse but emptied himself 
\textit{by} taking the form of a slave, 
\textit{by} becoming in the likeness of people. 
And being found in appearance like a man,
\verse he humbled himself 
\textit{by} becoming obedient to the point of death, 
that is, death on a cross.
\verse Therefore also God exalted him 
and graciously granted him the name above every name,
\verse so that at the name of Jesus 
every knee should bow, 
of \textit{those} in heaven and of \textit{those} on earth and of \textit{those} under the earth,
\verse and every tongue confess 
that Jesus Christ \textit{is} Lord, 
to the glory of God the Father.
\verseWithHeading{Holding Fast to the Word of Life} Therefore my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
\verse For the one at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure, is God.
\verse Do all \textit{things} without grumbling and disputing,
\verse in order that you may become blameless and innocent, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as stars in the world,
\verse holding fast to the word of life, for a source of pride to me in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.
\verse But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and rejoice with all of you.
\verse And \textit{in} the same \textit{way} also you rejoice and rejoice with me.
\verseWithHeading{Timothy’s Proven Character} But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I also may be encouraged \textit{when I} know \textit{your circumstances}.
\verse For I have no one like-minded who \textit{will} sincerely be concerned about \textit{your circumstances}.
\verse For they all seek \textit{their own interests}, not those of Jesus Christ.
\verse But you know his proven character, that like a child with a father he served with me for the gospel.
\verse Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see \textit{my circumstances}.
\verse And I am convinced in the Lord that I myself will arrive shortly also.
\verseWithHeading{Epaphroditus’ Mission} But I considered \textit{it} necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, but your messenger and servant of my need,
\verse because he was longing for all of you and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.
\verse For indeed he was sick, coming near to death, but God had mercy on him and not \textit{on} him only, but also \textit{on} me, so that I would not have grief upon grief.
\verse Therefore I am sending him with special urgency, in order that \textit{when} you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less anxious.
\verse Therefore welcome him in the Lord with all joy, and consider such \textit{people} highly honored,
\verse because on account of the work of Christ he came near to the point of death, risking his life in order that \textit{he might make up for your inability to serve me}.

\begin{biblechapter} % Philippians 3
\verseWithHeading{Warning Against Evil Workers} Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same \textit{things} to you \textit{is} not troublesome to me, but \textit{is} a safeguard for you.
\verse Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the mutilation.
\verse For we are the circumcision, the ones who worship by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and do not \textit{put} confidence in the flesh,
\verse although I \textit{could} have confidence even in the flesh.
\verseWithHeading{Righteousness Through Christ} If anyone else thinks to put confidence in the flesh, I \textit{can do so} more:
\verse \textit{circumcised on the eighth day}, from the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew \textit{born} from Hebrews, according to the law a Pharisee,
\verse according to zeal persecuting the church, according to the righteousness in the law being blameless.
\verse But whatever \textit{things} were gain to me, these \textit{things} I have considered loss because of Christ.
\verse \textit{More than that}, \textit{I} even consider all \textit{things} to be loss because of the surpassing greatness of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for the sake of whom I have suffered the loss of all \textit{things}, and consider \textit{them} dung, in order that I may gain Christ
\verse and may be found in him, not having my righteousness \textit{which is} from the law, but \textit{which is} through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God on the basis of faith,
\verse so that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,
\verse if somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
\verse Not that I have already received \textit{this}, or \textit{have} already been made perfect, but I press on if indeed I may lay hold of \textit{that} for which also I was laid hold of by Christ.
\verse Brothers, I do not consider myself to have laid hold of \textit{it}. But \textit{I do} one \textit{thing}, forgetting the things behind and straining toward the things ahead,
\verseWithHeading{Imitate Paul} Therefore as many as \textit{are} perfect, \textit{let us hold this opinion}, and if you think anything differently, God will reveal this also to you.
\verse Only to what we have attained, to the same hold on.
\verse Become fellow imitators of me, brothers, and observe those who walk in this way, just as you have us \textit{as} an example.
\verse For many live, of whom I spoke about to you many times, but now speak about even weeping, \textit{as} the enemies of the cross of Christ,
\verse whose end \textit{is} destruction, whose God \textit{is} the stomach, and \textit{whose} glory \textit{is} in their shame, the ones who think on earthly things.
\verse For our commonwealth exists in heaven, from which also we eagerly await a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
\verse who will transform our humble body \textit{to be} conformed to his glorious body, in accordance with the power that enables him even to subject all \textit{things} to himself.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Philippians 4
\verseWithHeading{Appeal for Unity} So then, my beloved and greatly desired brothers, my joy and crown, thus stand firm in the Lord, dear friends.
\verse I appeal to Euodia and I appeal to Syntyche \textit{to be in agreement} in the Lord.
\verse Yes, I ask also you, true yokefellow, help them, who struggled along with me in the gospel with both Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names \textit{are} in the book of life.
\verseWithHeading{Be Anxious for Nothing} Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice.
\verse Let your gentleness be made known to all people. The Lord \textit{is} near.
\verse Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
\verse And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
\verse Finally, brothers, whatever \textit{things} are true, whatever \textit{things are} honorable, whatever \textit{things are} right, whatever \textit{things are} pure, whatever \textit{things are} pleasing, whatever \textit{things are} commendable, if \textit{there is} any excellence of character and if anything praiseworthy, think about these \textit{things}.
\verse And \textit{the things} which you have learned and received and heard about and seen in me, practice these \textit{things}, and the God of peace will be with you.
\verseWithHeading{Support for Paul’s Ministry} But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last \textit{you have renewed your concern for me}, for whom also you were thinking, but you had no opportunity \textit{to express it}.
\verse Not that I speak from need, for I have learned to be content in whatever \textit{circumstances} I am.
\verse I know \textit{how} both \textit{to make do with little} and I know \textit{how} \textit{to have an abundance}. In everything and in all \textit{things} I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both \textit{to have an abundance} and to go without.
\verse I am able \textit{to do} all \textit{things} by the one who strengthens me.
\verse Nevertheless you have done well by sharing with me in my affliction.
\verse Now you also know, Philippians, that at the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone,
\verse because even in Thessalonica \textit{on more than one occasion} you sent for my need.
\verse Not that I seek the gift, but I seek for the profit that increases to your account.
\verse But I have received everything \textit{in full} and have an abundance; \textit{I am well supplied} \textit{because} I received from Epaphroditus \textit{what you had sent}, a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.
\verse And my God will fulfill your every need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
\verse Now to our God and Father \textit{be} the glory \textit{forever and ever}. Amen.
\verseWithHeading{Final Greetings and Benediction} Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers with me greet you.
\verse All the saints greet you, and especially those of Caesar’s household.
\verse The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ \textit{be} with your spirit.
