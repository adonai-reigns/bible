\verse{Now some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,}%
\verse{“Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?”}%
\verse{And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they were reasoning like this within themselves, said to them, “Why are you considering these things in your hearts?}%
\verse{Which is easier to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk’?}%

\verse{And other seed fell among the thorn plants, and the thorn plants came up and choked it, and it did not produce grain.\lnPWG{}}%
\verse{And other seed fell on the good soil, and produced grain,\lnPWG{}coming up and increasing, and it bore a crop—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much.\lnQOS{}}%
\verse{And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!”}%
\verseWithHeading{The Reason for the Parables}{And when he was alone, those around him together with the twelve began asking\lebnote{The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here (“began asking”)}him about the parables.}%
\verse{And he said to them, “To you has been granted the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside everything is in parables,}%
\verse{so that ‘\textit{they may look closely}\lebnote{Literally “seeing they may see”}and not perceive,

lest they turn and it be forgiven them.’ ”\lnPWL{}}%

\verse{And these are like\lebnote{Some manuscripts omit “like”}the ones sown on the rocky ground, who whenever they hear the word immediately receive it with joy.}%
\verse{And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Then whenaffliction or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away.}%
\verse{And others are the ones sown among the thorn plants—these are the ones who hear the word,}%
\verse{and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in andchoke the word and it becomes unproductive.}%
\verse{And those are the ones sown on the good soil, who hear the word and receive itand bear fruit—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much.”\lnQOS{}}%
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Lamp}{And he said to them, “Surely a lamp is not brought so that it may be put under a bushel basket or under a bed, is it?\lebnote{The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase “is it”}Is it not\lebnote{The negative construction in Greek anticipates a positive answer here}so that it may be put on a lampstand?}%

\verse{And he said to them, “Take care what you hear! With the measure by which you measure out, it will be measured out to you, and will be added to you.}%

\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Mustard Seed}{And he said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or by what parable can we present it?}%
\verse{It is like a mustard seed that when sown on the ground, although itis the smallest of all the seeds that are on the ground,}%
\verse{but when it is sown it grows up and becomes the largest of all the garden herbs, and sends out large branches so that the birds of the sky are able to nest in its shade.”}%

\verse{who \textit{lived}\lebnote{Literally “had his dwelling”}among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him any longer, not even with a chain,}%
