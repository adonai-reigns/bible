\begin{biblechapter} % Mark 1
\verseWithHeading{John the Baptist Begins His Ministry} The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
\verse Just as it is written in the prophet Isaiah,
\verse “Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, 
who will prepare your way,
\verse John was there baptizing in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
\verse And all the Judean region and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
\verse And John was dressed in camel’s hair and a belt made of leather around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
\verse And he was preaching, saying, “One \textit{who is} more powerful than I is coming after me, of whom I am not worthy to bend down \textit{and} untie the strap of his sandals.
\verse I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
\verseWithHeading{The Baptism of Jesus} And it happened that in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.
\verse And immediately \textit{as he} was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being split apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him.
\verse And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”
\verseWithHeading{The Temptation of Jesus} And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
\verse And he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.
\verseWithHeading{Public Ministry in Galilee} And after John \textit{had been taken into custody}, Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God
\verse and saying, “The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the gospel!”
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Calls His First Disciples} And \textit{as he} was passing by along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting \textit{a net} into the sea (for they were fishermen).
\verse And Jesus said to them, “\textit{Follow} me and I will make you become fishers of people.”
\verse And immediately they left their nets \textit{and} followed him.
\verse And going on a little \textit{farther}, he saw James the \textit{son} of Zebedee and his brother John, and they \textit{were} in the boat mending the nets.
\verse And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men \textit{and} went away after him.
\verse And they went into Capernaum and immediately on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue.
\verseWithHeading{A Man with an Unclean Spirit Healed} And they were amazed at his teaching, because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like the scribes.
\verse And so then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,
\verse saying, “\textit{Leave us alone}, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
\verse And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!”
\verse And \textit{after} convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, the unclean spirit came out of him.
\verse And they were all amazed, so that \textit{they began} to discuss with one another, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him.”
\verse And the report about him then went out everywhere in the whole surrounding region of Galilee.
\verseWithHeading{Many at Capernaum Are Healed} And so then he departed from the synagogue \textit{and} came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.
\verse Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down, suffering with a fever, and at once they told him about her.
\verse And he came \textit{and} raised her up \textit{by} taking hold of her hand, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.
\verse Now \textit{when it} was evening, when the sun had set, they began bringing to him all those \textit{who were sick} and those who were demon-possessed.
\verse And the whole town was gathered together at the door.
\verse And he healed many \textit{who were sick} with various diseases and expelled many demons. And he did not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.
\verseWithHeading{Preaching Throughout Galilee} And getting up early in the morning \textit{while it was} very dark, he departed and went to a deserted place, and there he was praying.
\verse And Simon and those \textit{who were} with him searched diligently for him.
\verse And they found him and said to him, “Everyone is looking for you!”
\verse And he said to them, “Let us go elsewhere, into the neighboring rural towns, so that I can preach there also, because I have come out for this \textit{very} reason.”
\verse And he went into all Galilee preaching in their synagogues and expelling demons.
\verseWithHeading{A Leper Cleansed} And a leper came to him, entreating him and kneeling down, saying to him, “If you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”
\verse And becoming angry, he stretched out his hand \textit{and} touched \textit{him}, and said to him, “I am willing; be made clean.”
\verse And immediately the leprosy went away from him and he was made clean.
\verse And warning him sternly, he sent him away at once.
\verse And he said to him, “See to it that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and bring for your cleansing \textit{the things} which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
\verse But he went out \textit{and} began to proclaim \textit{it} freely and to spread abroad the account, so that he was no longer able to enter publicly into a town. But he was staying outside in deserted places, and they were coming to him from all directions.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Mark 2
\verseWithHeading{A Paralytic Healed} And \textit{when he} entered again into Capernaum after \textit{some} days, it became known that he was at home.
\verse And many had gathered, so that \textit{there was} no longer room, not even at the door, and he was speaking the word to them.
\verse And they came bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four \textit{of them}.
\verse And \textit{when} they were not able to bring \textit{him} to him because of the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. And \textit{after} digging through, they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying.
\verse And \textit{when} Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Child, your sins are forgiven.”
\verse Now some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,
\verse “Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?”
\verse And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they were reasoning like this within themselves, said to them, “Why are you considering these \textit{things} in your hearts?
\verse Which is easier to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk’?
\verse But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”—he said to the paralytic—
\verse “I say to you, get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.”
\verse And he got up and immediately picked up his stretcher \textit{and} went out in front of \textit{them} all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen \textit{anything} like this!”
\verseWithHeading{Levi Called to Follow Jesus} And he went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he began to teach them.
\verse And \textit{as he} was passing by, he saw Levi the \textit{son} of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me!” And he stood up \textit{and} followed him.
\verse And it happened that he \textit{was dining} in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners \textit{were dining with} Jesus and his disciples, for there were many and they were following him.
\verse And the scribes of the Pharisees, \textit{when they} saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, began to say to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
\verse And \textit{when} Jesus heard \textit{it}, he said to them, “Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician, but those \textit{who are sick}. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”
\verseWithHeading{On Fasting} And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and said to him, “\textit{Why} do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”
\verse And Jesus said to them, “The \textit{bridegroom’s attendants} are not able to fast while the bridegroom is with them, \textit{are they}? As long a time \textit{as} they have the bridegroom with them, they are not able to fast.
\verse But days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.
\verse No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment. \textit{Otherwise} the patch pulls away from it—the new from the old—and the tear becomes worse.
\verse And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. \textit{Otherwise} the wine will burst the wineskins and the wine is destroyed and the wineskins \textit{too}. But new wine \textit{is put} into new wineskins.”
\verseWithHeading{Plucking Grain on the Sabbath} And it happened that he was going through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and his disciples began to make \textit{their} way \textit{while} plucking off the heads of grain.
\verse And the Pharisees began to say to him, “Behold, why are they doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath?”
\verse And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he had need and he and those \textit{who were} with him were hungry—
\verse how he entered into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the presentation, which it is not permitted to eat (except the priests) and also gave \textit{it} to those who were with him?”
\verse And he said to them, “The Sabbath was established for people, and not people for the Sabbath.
\verse So then, the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Mark 3
\verseWithHeading{A Man with a Withered Hand Healed} And he entered into the synagogue again, and a man who had a withered hand was there.
\verse And they were watching him closely \textit{to see} if he would heal him on the Sabbath, in order that they could accuse him.
\verse And he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come into the middle.”
\verse And he said to them, “Is it permitted on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent.
\verse And looking around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched \textit{it} out, and his hand was restored.
\verse And the Pharisees went out immediately with the Herodians \textit{and began to conspire} against him with regard to how they could destroy him.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Heals Crowds by the Sea} And Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd from Galilee followed \textit{him}. And from Judea
\verse and from Jerusalem and from Idumea and the other side of the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon a great crowd came to him \textit{because they} heard all that he was doing.
\verse And he told his disciples that a small boat should stand ready for him because of the crowd, so that they would not press upon him.
\verse For he had healed many, so that all those who \textit{were suffering from diseases} pressed about him in order that they could touch him.
\verse And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, were falling down before him and crying out, saying, “You are the Son of God!”
\verse And he warned them strictly that they should not make him known.
\verseWithHeading{The Selection of the Twelve Apostles} And he went up on the mountain and summoned \textit{those} whom he wanted, and they came to him.
\verse And he appointed twelve, so that they would be with him and so that he could send them out to preach
\verse and to have authority to expel demons.
\verse And he appointed the twelve. And to Simon he gave the name Peter,
\verse and James the \textit{son} of Zebedee and John the brother of James (and he gave to them the name Boanerges, that is, “Sons of Thunder”),
\verse and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the \textit{son} of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot,
\verse and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
\verseWithHeading{A House Divided Cannot Stand} And he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they were not even able to eat a meal.
\verse And \textit{when} \textit{his family} heard \textit{this}, they went out to restrain him, for they were saying, “He has lost his mind!”
\verse And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul!” and “By the ruler of the demons he expels the demons!”
\verse And he called them to himself \textit{and} was speaking to them in parables, “How can Satan expel Satan?
\verse And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand.
\verse And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
\verse And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand, but is at an end!
\verse But no one is able to enter into the house of a strong \textit{man} \textit{and} plunder his property unless he first ties up the strong \textit{man}, and then he can thoroughly plunder his house.
\verse “Truly I say to you that all the sins and the blasphemies will be forgiven the sons of men, however much they blaspheme.
\verse But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit does not have forgiveness \textit{forever}, but is guilty of \textit{an} eternal sin”—
\verse because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”
\verseWithHeading{Jesus’ Mother and Brothers} And his mother and his brothers arrived, and standing outside, they sent \textit{word} to him to summon him.
\verse And a crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers \textit{are} outside looking for you.”
\verse And he answered them \textit{and} said, “Who is my mother or my brothers?”
\verse And looking around at those who were sitting around him in a circle, he said, “Behold, my mother and my brothers!
\verse For whoever does the will of God, this person is my brother and sister and mother.”
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Mark 4
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Sower} And again he began to teach beside the sea, and a very large crowd was gathered to him, so that he got into a boat \textit{and} sat on the sea, and the whole crowd was at the sea on the land.
\verse And he began to teach them many \textit{things} in parables, and was saying to them in his teaching,
\verse “Listen! Behold, the sower went out to sow.
\verse And it happened that while \textit{he} was sowing, \textit{some seed} fell on the side of the path, and the birds came and devoured it.
\verse And other \textit{seed} fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up at once, because it did not have \textit{any} depth of soil.
\verse And when the sun rose it was scorched, and because it did not have \textit{enough} root, it withered.
\verse And other \textit{seed} fell among the thorn plants, and the thorn plants came up and choked it, and it did not produce grain.
\verse And other \textit{seed} fell on the good soil, and produced grain, coming up and increasing, and it bore \textit{a crop}—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred \textit{times as much}.
\verse And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!”
\verseWithHeading{The Reason for the Parables} And when he was alone, those around him together with the twelve began asking him about the parables.
\verse And he said to them, “To you has been granted the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside everything is in parables,
\verse so that ‘\textit{they may look closely} and not perceive, 
and \textit{they may listen carefully} and not understand, 
lest they turn and it be forgiven them.’ ”
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Sower Interpreted} And he said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? And how will you understand all the parables?
\verse The sower sows the word.
\verse And these are the ones beside the path where the word is sown, and whenever they hear \textit{it}, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.
\verse And these are like the ones sown on the rocky ground, who whenever they hear the word immediately receive it with joy.
\verse And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Then \textit{when} affliction or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away.
\verse And others are the ones sown among the thorn plants—these are the ones who hear the word,
\verse and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other \textit{things} come in \textit{and} choke the word and it becomes unproductive.
\verse And those are the ones sown on the good soil, who hear the word and receive \textit{it} and bear fruit—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred \textit{times as much}.”
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Lamp} And he said to them, “Surely a lamp is not brought so that it may be put under a bushel basket or under a bed, \textit{is it}? \textit{Is it} not so that it may be put on a lampstand?
\verse For nothing is secret except so that it may be revealed, nor has become hidden except so that it will come to light.
\verse If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”
\verse And he said to them, “Take care what you hear! With the measure by which you measure out, it will be measured out to you, and will be added to you.
\verse For whoever has, \textit{more} will be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Seed that Grows by Itself} And he said, “The kingdom of God is like this: like a man scatters seed on the ground.
\verse And he sleeps and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows—\textit{he does not know how}.
\verse By itself the soil produces a crop: first the grass, then the head of grain, then the full grain in the head.
\verse But when the crop permits, he sends \textit{in} the sickle right away, because the harvest has come.”
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Mustard Seed} And he said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or by what parable can we present it?
\verse \textit{It is} like a mustard seed that when sown on the ground, \textit{although it} is the smallest of all the seeds that \textit{are} on the ground,
\verse but when it is sown it grows up and becomes the largest of all the garden herbs, and sends out large branches so that the birds of the sky are able to nest in its shade.”
\verse And with many parables such as these he was speaking the word to them, as they were able to hear \textit{it}.
\verse And he did not speak to them without a parable, but in private he explained everything to his own disciples.
\verseWithHeading{Calming of a Storm} And on that day, \textit{when it} was evening, he said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side.”
\verse And leaving the crowd, they took him along, as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.
\verse And a great storm of wind developed, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already being filled \textit{with water}.
\verse And he was in the stern sleeping on the cushion, and they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, is it not a concern to you that we are perishing?”
\verse And he woke up \textit{and} rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Be quiet! Be silent!” And the wind abated and there was a great calm.
\verse And he said to them, “Why are you fearful? Do you not yet have faith?”
\verse And \textit{they were terribly frightened} and began to say to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Mark 5
\verseWithHeading{A Demon-possessed Gerasene Healed} And they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes.
\verse And \textit{as} he was getting out of the boat, immediately from the tombs a man with an unclean spirit went to meet him,
\verse who \textit{lived} among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him any longer, not even with a chain,
\verse because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles had been shattered. And no one was strong \textit{enough} to subdue him.
\verse And during every night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.
\verse And \textit{when he} saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and knelt down before him.
\verse And crying out with a loud voice he said, “\textit{What have I to do with you}, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, do not torment me!”
\verse (For he was saying to him, “Come out of the man, unclean spirit!”)
\verse And he was asking him “\textit{What is your name}?” And he said to him, “My name \textit{is} Legion, because we are many.”
\verse And he was imploring him many \textit{times} that he would not send them out of the region.
\verse Now a large herd of pigs was there at the hill feeding,
\verse and they implored him, saying, “Send us to the pigs so that we may enter into them.”
\verse And he permitted them. And the unclean spirits came out \textit{and} entered into the pigs, and the herd—about two thousand—rushed headlong down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea.
\verse And their herdsmen fled and reported \textit{it} in the town and in the countryside, and they came to see what it was that had happened.
\verse And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting \textit{there} clothed and in his right mind—the one who had had the legion—and they were afraid.
\verse And those who had seen \textit{it} described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and about the pigs.
\verse And they began to urge him to depart from their region.
\verse And \textit{as} he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed began to implore him that he could go with him.
\verse And he did not permit him, but said to him, “Go to your home to your \textit{people} and tell them all that the Lord has done for you, and \textit{that} he has had mercy on you.”
\verse And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him, and they were all astonished.
\verseWithHeading{A Woman Healed and a Daughter Raised} And \textit{after} Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered to him, and he was beside the sea.
\verse And one of the rulers of the synagogue came—Jairus by name—and \textit{when he} saw him, he fell down at his feet.
\verse And he was imploring him many \textit{times}, saying, “My little daughter \textit{is at the point of death}! Come, lay your hands on her, so that she will get well and will live.”
\verse And he went with him, and a large crowd was following him and pressing around him.
\verse And \textit{there was} a woman who was \textit{suffering from hemorrhages} twelve years.
\verse And she had endured many \textit{things} under many physicians, and had spent \textit{all that she had} and had received no \textit{help} at all, but instead \textit{became worse}.
\verse \textit{When she} heard about Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind \textit{him} \textit{and} touched his cloak,
\verse for she was saying, “If I touch just his clothing, I will be healed!”
\verse And immediately her \textit{hemorrhage stopped} and she realized in her body that she was healed of her suffering.
\verse And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself \textit{that} power had gone out from himself, turned around in the crowd \textit{and} said, “Who touched my clothing?”
\verse And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing upon you, and you say ‘Who touched me?’ ”
\verse And he was looking around to see the one who had done this.
\verse So the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.
\verse But he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be well from your suffering.”
\verse \textit{While} he was still speaking, they came from the synagogue ruler’s \textit{house} saying, “Your daughter has died. Why trouble the Teacher further?”
\verse But Jesus, ignoring \textit{what was said}, told the ruler of the synagogue, “Do not be afraid—only believe!”
\verse And he did not allow anyone to follow along with him except Peter and James and John, the brother of James.
\verse And they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and saw a commotion, and \textit{people} weeping and wailing loudly.
\verse And \textit{when he} entered, he said to them, “Why are you agitated and weeping? The child is not dead, but is sleeping.”
\verse And they began laughing at him. But he sent \textit{them} all out \textit{and} took along the father and mother of the child, and those \textit{who were} with him, and went in to where the child was.
\verse And taking hold of the child’s hand, he said to her, “\textit{Talitha koum!}” (which is translated, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”),
\verse and immediately the girl stood up and began walking around (for she was twelve years old). And \textit{immediately they were utterly and completely astonished}.
\verse And he commanded them strictly that no one should learn of this, and said to give her \textit{something} to eat.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Mark 6
\verseWithHeading{Rejected at Nazareth} And he went out from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.
\verse And \textit{when} the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard \textit{him} were amazed, saying, “Where did this man \textit{get} these \textit{things}? And what \textit{is} this wisdom that has been granted to this man, and the miracles such as these performed through his hands?
\verse Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” And they were offended by him.
\verse And Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, and among his relatives, and in his \textit{own} household.”
\verse And he was not able to do any miracle in that place except to lay his hands on a few sick \textit{people} \textit{and} heal \textit{them}.
\verse And he was astonished because of their unbelief.
\verseWithHeading{The Twelve Commissioned and Sent Out} And he was going around among the villages teaching.
\verse And he summoned the twelve and began to send them out two \textit{by} two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.
\verse And he commanded them that they take along nothing for the journey except only a staff—no bread, no traveler’s bag, no money in their belts—
\verse but to put on sandals and not to wear two tunics.
\verse And he said to them, “Whenever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there.
\verse And whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, \textit{as you} go out from there, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.”
\verse And they went out \textit{and} proclaimed that \textit{people} should repent.
\verseWithHeading{Herod Kills John the Baptist} And King Herod heard \textit{it}, because his name had become known. And they were saying, “John, the one who baptizes, has been raised from the dead, and because of this these miraculous powers are at work in him.”
\verse But others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and others were saying, “\textit{He is} a prophet like one of the prophets.”
\verse But \textit{when} Herod heard \textit{it}, he said, “John whom I beheaded—this one has been raised!”
\verse For Herod himself had sent \textit{and} arrested John and bound him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.
\verse For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not permitted for you to have your brother’s wife.”
\verse So Herodias held a grudge against him and was wanting to kill him, and was not able \textit{to do so}.
\verse For Herod was afraid of John, \textit{because he} knew him \textit{to be} a righteous and holy man and protected him. And \textit{when he} listened to him, he was greatly perplexed, and \textit{yet} he listened to him gladly.
\verse And a suitable day came when Herod, on his birthday, gave a banquet for his courtiers and military tribunes and the most prominent \textit{men} of Galilee.
\verse And \textit{when} the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced and pleased Herod and \textit{his dinner guests}, the king said to the girl, “Ask me \textit{for} whatever you want, and I will give \textit{it} to you.”
\verse And he swore to her, “Anything whatever you ask me for I will give you, up to half my kingdom!”
\verse And she went out \textit{and} said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” And she said, “The head of John the baptizer.”
\verse And she came in immediately with haste to the king \textit{and} asked, saying, “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.”
\verse And \textit{although he} was deeply grieved, the king, because of his oaths and \textit{dinner guests}, did not want to refuse her.
\verse And immediately the king sent an executioner \textit{and} ordered \textit{him} to bring his head. And he went \textit{and} beheaded him in the prison.
\verse And he brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
\verse And \textit{when} his disciples heard \textit{this}, they came and took away his corpse and placed it in a tomb.
\verseWithHeading{The Feeding of Five Thousand} And the apostles regathered to Jesus and reported to him everything that they had done and that they had taught.
\verse And he said to them, “You yourselves come privately to an isolated place and rest for a short time.” For those \textit{who were} coming and going were many, and they did not even have time to eat.
\verse And they went away in the boat to an isolated place by themselves.
\verse And many \textit{people} saw them leaving and recognized \textit{them}, and ran there together by land from all the towns, and arrived ahead of them.
\verse And getting out \textit{of the boat} he saw the large crowd and had compassion on them, because they were like sheep \textit{without} a shepherd, and he began to teach them many \textit{things}.
\verse And the hour had already become late \textit{when} his disciples came up to him, saying, “The place is desolate and the hour \textit{is} already late.
\verse Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding farms and villages \textit{and} purchase something to eat for themselves.”
\verse But he answered \textit{and} said to them, “You give them \textit{something} to eat.” And they said to him, “Should we go \textit{and} purchase bread for two hundred denarii and give \textit{it} to them to eat?”
\verse And he said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go look!” And \textit{when they} found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.”
\verse And he ordered them all to recline in groups on the green grass.
\verse And they reclined in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.
\verse And taking the five loaves and the two fish \textit{and} looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves and gave \textit{them} to his disciples so that they could set \textit{them} before them. And he distributed the two fish to \textit{them} all.
\verse And they all ate and were satisfied.
\verse And they picked up the broken pieces, twelve baskets full, and of the fish.
\verse And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Walks on the Water} And immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself dismissed the crowd.
\verse And \textit{after he} had said farewell to them, he went away to the mountain to pray.
\verse And \textit{when} evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea and he \textit{was} alone on the land.
\verse And he saw them being beaten in their rowing because the wind was against them. Around the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he was wanting to pass by them.
\verse But \textit{when} they saw him walking on the sea, they thought that it was a ghost, and they cried out.
\verse For they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke with them and said to them, “Have courage, I am \textit{he}! Do not be afraid!”
\verse And he went up with them into the boat, and the wind abated. And \textit{they were extraordinarily} astounded within themselves,
\verse because they did not understand concerning the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.
\verseWithHeading{Many Healed at Gennesaret} And \textit{after they} had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored \textit{there}.
\verse And \textit{as} they were getting out of the boat, \textit{people} recognized him immediately.
\verse They ran about \textit{through} that whole region and began to carry around those \textit{who were sick} on stretchers, wherever they heard that he was.
\verse And wherever he would go, into villages or into towns or to farms, they would put those who were sick in the marketplaces and would implore him that if they could touch even the edge of his cloak. And all those who touched it were healed.

\begin{biblechapter} % Mark 7
\verseWithHeading{Human Traditions and God’s Commandments} And the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered to him.
\verse And they saw that some of his disciples were eating their bread with unclean—that is, unwashed—hands.
\verse (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands \textit{ritually}, \textit{thus} holding fast to the traditions of the elders.
\verse And \textit{when they come} from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other \textit{traditions} which they have received \textit{and} hold fast to—\textit{for example,} the washing of cups and pitchers and bronze kettles and dining couches.)
\verse And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unclean hands?”
\verse So he said to them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written,
\verse ‘This people honors me with their lips, 
but their heart is far, far away from me.
\verse Abandoning the commandment of God, you hold fast to the tradition of men.”
\verse And he said to them, “You splendidly ignore the commandment of God so that you can keep your tradition.
\verse For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘The one who speaks evil of father or mother \textit{must certainly die}.’
\verse But you say, ‘If a man says to his father or to his mother, “Whatever \textit{benefit you would have received} from me \textit{is} \textit{corban}” (that is, a gift \textit{to God}),
\verse you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother,
\verse \textit{thus} making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down, and you do many similar \textit{things} such as this.”
\verseWithHeading{Defilement from Within} And summoning the crowd again, he said to them, “Listen to me, all \textit{of you}, and understand:
\verse There is nothing outside of a person that is able to defile him \textit{by} going into him. But the things that go out of a person are the things that defile a person.”
\verse And when he entered into the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable.
\verse And he said to them, “So are you also without understanding? Do you not understand that everything \textit{that is} outside that goes into a person \textit{is} not able to defile him?
\verse For it does not enter into his heart but into his stomach, and goes out into the latrine”—\textit{thus} declaring all foods clean.
\verse And he said, “What comes out of a person, that defiles a person.
\verse For from within, from the heart of people, come evil plans, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders,
\verse adulteries, \textit{acts of} greed, malicious \textit{deeds}, deceit, licentiousness, \textit{envy}, abusive speech, pride, foolishness.
\verse All these evil \textit{things} come from within and defile a person.”
\verseWithHeading{A Syrophoenician Woman’s Great Faith} And from there he set out \textit{and} went to the region of Tyre. And \textit{when he} entered into a house, he wanted no one to know, and \textit{yet} he was not able to escape notice.
\verse But immediately a woman whose young daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, \textit{when she} heard about him, came \textit{and} fell down at his feet,
\verse Now the woman was a Greek—a Syrophoenician by nationality—and she was asking him that he would expel the demon from her daughter.
\verse And he said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw \textit{it} to the dogs!”
\verse But she answered and said to him, “Lord, even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”
\verse And he said to her, “Because of this statement, go! The demon has gone out of your daughter.”
\verse And \textit{when she} went to her home, she found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone.
\verseWithHeading{A Man Deaf and Unable to Speak Healed} And again he went away from the region of Tyre \textit{and} came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of the Decapolis.
\verse And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they were imploring him that he would place his hand on him.
\verse And he took him away from the crowd by himself \textit{and} put his fingers into his ears, and \textit{after} spitting, he touched his tongue.
\verse And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, “\textit{Ephphatha!}” (that is, “Be opened!”).
\verse And his ears were opened and \textit{his difficulty in speaking was removed} and he began to speak normally.
\verse And he ordered them that they should say nothing, but as much as he ordered them \textit{not to}, they proclaimed \textit{it} even more instead.
\verse And they were amazed beyond all measure, saying, “He has done all \textit{things} well! He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak!”

\begin{biblechapter} % Mark 8
\verseWithHeading{The Feeding of Four Thousand} In those days there was again a large crowd, and they did not have anything they could eat. Summoning the disciples, he said to them,
\verse “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat.
\verse And if I send them away hungry to their homes they will give out on the way, and some of them have come from far away.”
\verse And his disciples answered him, “Where is anyone able to feed these \textit{people} with bread here in the desert?”
\verse And he asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” So they said, “Seven.”
\verse And he commanded the crowd to recline for a meal on the ground, and taking the seven loaves, \textit{after he} had given thanks he broke \textit{them} and began giving \textit{them} to his disciples so that they could set \textit{them} before \textit{them}. And they set \textit{them} before the crowd.
\verse And they had a few small fish, and \textit{after} giving thanks for them, he said to set these \textit{before them} also.
\verse And they ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces that were left, seven baskets \textit{full}.
\verse Now there were about four thousand. And he sent them away.
\verse And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples \textit{and} went to the district of Dalmanutha.
\verseWithHeading{Pharisees Demand a Sign} And the Pharisees came and began to argue with him, demanding from him a sign from heaven \textit{in order to} test him.
\verse And sighing deeply in his spirit, he said, “Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation!”
\verse And he left them, got into \textit{the boat} again, \textit{and} went to the other side.
\verseWithHeading{Beware the Leaven of the Pharisees and Herod} And they had forgotten to take bread, and except \textit{for} one loaf, they did not have \textit{any} with them in the boat.
\verse And he ordered them, saying, “Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod!”
\verse And they began to discuss with one another that they had no bread.
\verse And knowing \textit{this}, he said to them, “Why are you discussing that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Have your hearts been hardened?
\verse \textit{Although you} have eyes, do you not see? And \textit{although you} have ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?
\verse When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?” They said to him, “Twelve.”
\verse “When \textit{I} also \textit{broke} the seven \textit{loaves} for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?” And they said to him, “Seven.”
\verse And he said to them, “Do you not yet understand?”
\verseWithHeading{A Blind Man Healed at Bethsaida} And they came to Bethsaida. And they brought to him a blind man and implored him that he would touch him.
\verse And he took hold of the blind man’s hand \textit{and} led him outside the village, and \textit{after} spitting in his eyes, he placed his hands on him \textit{and} asked him, “Do you see anything?”
\verse And looking up he said, “I see people, for I see \textit{them} like trees walking around.”
\verse Then he placed his hands on his eyes again, and he opened his eyes and was cured, and could see everything clearly.
\verse And he sent him to his home, saying, “Do not even go into the village.”
\verseWithHeading{Peter’s Confession at Caesarea Philippi} And Jesus and his disciples went out to the villages of Caesarea Philippi, and on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, “Who do people say \textit{that} I am?”
\verse And they told him, saying, “John the Baptist, and others Elijah, and others that \textit{you are} one of the prophets.”
\verse And he asked them, “But who do you say \textit{that} I am?” Peter answered \textit{and} said to him, “You are the Christ!”
\verse And he warned them that they should tell no one about him.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection} And he began to teach them that it was necessary \textit{for} the Son of Man to suffer many \textit{things} and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise.
\verse And he was speaking openly \textit{about} the subject, and Peter took him aside \textit{and} began to rebuke him.
\verse But turning around and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan, because you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but the things of people!”
\verseWithHeading{Taking Up One’s Cross to Follow Jesus} And summoning the crowd together with his disciples, he said to them, “If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
\verse For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of me and of the gospel will save it.
\verse For what does it benefit a person to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?
\verse For what can a person give in exchange for his life?
\verse For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Mark 9
\verse And he said to them, “Truly I say to you, that there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the kingdom of God having come with power.”
\verseWithHeading{The Transfiguration} And after six days, Jesus took along Peter and James and John, and led them to a high mountain by themselves alone. And he was transfigured before them,
\verse and his clothing became radiant—extremely white, like no cloth refiner on earth can \textit{make so white}.
\verse And Elijah appeared to them together with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
\verse And Peter answered \textit{and} said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good \textit{that} we are here! And let us make three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
\verse (For he did not know what he should answer, because they were terrified.)
\verse And a cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came from the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”
\verse And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus alone.
\verse And \textit{as} they were coming down from the mountain, he ordered them that they should tell no one \textit{the things} that they had seen, except when the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
\verse And they kept the matter to themselves, discussing what this rising from the dead \textit{meant}.
\verse And they asked him, saying, “\textit{Why do} the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
\verse And he said to them, “Elijah indeed does come first \textit{and} restores all \textit{things}. And how is it written concerning the Son of Man that he should suffer many \textit{things} and be treated with contempt?
\verse But I tell you that indeed Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.”
\verseWithHeading{A Demon-possessed Boy Healed} And \textit{when they} came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and scribes arguing with them.
\verse And immediately the whole crowd, \textit{when they} saw him, were amazed, and ran up to \textit{him} \textit{and} greeted him.
\verse And he asked them, “What are you arguing \textit{about} with them?”
\verse And one \textit{individual} from the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought to you my son who has \textit{a spirit that makes him mute}.
\verse And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes paralyzed. And I told your disciples that they should expel it, and they were not able \textit{to do so}.
\verse And he answered them \textit{and} said, “O unbelieving generation! \textit{How long} will I be with you? \textit{How long} must I put up with you? Bring him to me!”
\verse And they brought him to him. And \textit{when he} saw him, the spirit immediately convulsed him, and falling on the ground, he began to roll around, foaming at the mouth.
\verse And he asked his father how long it was since this had been happening to him. And he said, “From childhood.
\verse And often it has thrown him both into fire and into water, in order that it could destroy him. But if you are able \textit{to do} anything, have compassion on us \textit{and} help us!”
\verse But Jesus said to him, “If you are able! All \textit{things} \textit{are} possible for the one who believes!”
\verse Immediately the father of the child cried out \textit{and} said, “I believe! Help my unbelief!”
\verse Now \textit{when} Jesus saw that a crowd was running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and enter into him no more!”
\verse And it came out, screaming and convulsing \textit{him} greatly, and he became as if \textit{he were} dead, so that most \textit{of them} said, “He has died!”
\verse But Jesus took hold of his hand \textit{and} raised him up, and he stood up.
\verse And \textit{after} he had entered into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why were we not able to expel it?”
\verse And he said to them, “This kind can come out by nothing except by prayer.”
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection a Second Time} And from there they went out \textit{and} passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know,
\verse for he was teaching his disciples and was telling them, “The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And \textit{when he} is killed, after three days he will rise.”
\verse But they did not understand the statement, and they were afraid to ask him.
\verseWithHeading{The Question About Who Is Greatest} And they came to Capernaum. And \textit{after he} was in the house, he asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?”
\verse But they were silent, because they had argued with one another on the way \textit{about} who \textit{was} greatest.
\verse And he sat down \textit{and} called the twelve and said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he will be last of all and servant of all.”
\verse And he took a young child \textit{and} had him stand \textit{among them}. And taking him in his arms, he said to them,
\verse “Whoever welcomes one of the young children such as these in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me, but the one who sent me.”
\verseWithHeading{Whoever Is Not Against Us Is for Us} John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone expelling demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us.”
\verse But Jesus said, “Do not prevent him, because there is no one who does a miracle in my name and will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.
\verse For whoever is not against us is for us.
\verse For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in \textit{my} name because you are Christ’s, truly I say to you that he will never lose his reward.
\verseWithHeading{Temptations to Sin} “And whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it is better for him if instead \textit{a large millstone} is placed around his neck and he is thrown into the sea.
\verse And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better \textit{for} you to enter into life crippled than, having two hands, to go into hell—into the unquenchable fire!
\verse And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better \textit{for} you to enter into life lame than, having two feet, to be thrown into hell!
\verse And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out! It is better \textit{for} you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than, having two eyes, to be thrown into hell,
\verse ‘where their worm does not die and the fire is not extinguished.’
\verse For everyone will be salted with fire.
\verse Salt \textit{is} good, but if the salt becomes deprived of its salt content, by what can you make it salty? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Mark 10
\verseWithHeading{On Divorce} And from there he set out \textit{and} came to the region of Judea and the other side of the Jordan, and again crowds came together to him. And again, as he was accustomed \textit{to do}, he began to teach them.
\verse And they asked him if it was permitted for a man to divorce \textit{his} wife, \textit{in order to} test him.
\verse And he answered \textit{and} said to them, “What did Moses command you?”
\verse So they said, “Moses permitted \textit{a man} to write a certificate of divorce and to send \textit{her} away.”
\verse But Jesus said to them, “He wrote this commandment for you because of your hardness of heart.
\verse But from the beginning of creation ‘he made them male and female.
\verse Because of this a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife,
\verse and the two will become one flesh,’ so that they are no longer two but one flesh.
\verse Therefore what God has joined together, man must not separate.”
\verse And in the house again the disciples began to ask him about this.
\verse And he said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.
\verse And if she divorces her husband \textit{and} marries another, she commits adultery.”
\verseWithHeading{Little Children Brought to Jesus} And they were bringing young children to him so that he could touch them, but the disciples rebuked them.
\verse But \textit{when} Jesus saw \textit{it}, he was indignant, and said to them, “Let the young children come to me. Do not forbid them, \textit{for to such belongs} the kingdom of God.
\verse Truly I say to you, whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a young child will never enter into it.”
\verse And \textit{after} taking \textit{them} into his arms, he blessed them, placing his hands on them.
\verseWithHeading{A Rich Young Man} And \textit{as} he was setting out on \textit{his} way, one \textit{individual} ran up and knelt down before him \textit{and} asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do so that I will inherit eternal life?”
\verse So Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one \textit{is} good except God alone.
\verse You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.’ ”
\verse And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth.”
\verse And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one \textit{thing}: Go, sell all that you have, and give \textit{the proceeds} to the poor—and you will have treasure in heaven—and come, follow me.”
\verse But he looked gloomy at the statement \textit{and} went away sorrowful, \textit{because he had} many possessions.
\verse And Jesus looked around \textit{and} said to his disciples, “How \textit{difficult it is for} those who possess wealth to enter into the kingdom of God!”
\verse And the disciples were astounded at his words. But Jesus answered \textit{and} said to them again, “Children, how difficult it is to enter into the kingdom of God!
\verse It is easier \textit{for} a camel to go through the eye of a needle than \textit{for} a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God.”
\verse And they were very astounded, saying to one another, “And who can be saved?”
\verse Jesus looked at them \textit{and} said, “With human beings \textit{it is} impossible, but not with God. For all \textit{things} \textit{are} possible with God.”
\verse Peter began to say to him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed you.”
\verse Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields on account of me and on account of the gospel
\verse \textit{who will not} receive a hundred times as much now in this time—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, together with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life.
\verse But many \textit{who are} first will be last, and the last first.”
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection a Third Time} Now they were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going on ahead of them. And they were astounded, but those who were following \textit{him} were afraid. And taking aside the twelve again, he began to tell them the things that were about to happen to him:
\verse “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles.
\verse And they will mock him and spit on him and flog him and kill \textit{him}, and after three days he will rise.”
\verseWithHeading{A Request by James and John} And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him \textit{and} said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask you.”
\verse And he said to them, “What do you want that I do for you?”
\verse So they said to him, “Grant to us that we may sit one at your right hand and one at \textit{your} left in your glory.”
\verse But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”
\verse And they said to him, “We are able.” So Jesus said to them, “You will drink the cup that I drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with,
\verse but to sit at my right hand or at \textit{my} left is not mine to grant, but \textit{is} for those for whom it has been prepared.”
\verse And \textit{when they} heard \textit{this}, the ten began to be indignant about James and John.
\verse And Jesus called them to himself \textit{and} said to them, “You know that those who are considered to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their \textit{people} in high positions exercise authority over them.
\verse But it is not like this among you! But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
\verse and whoever wants to be most prominent among you must be the slave of all.
\verse For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life \textit{as} a ransom for many.”
\verseWithHeading{A Blind Man Healed at Jericho} And they came to Jericho. And \textit{as} he was setting out from Jericho along with his disciples and a large crowd, a blind beggar, Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus, was sitting beside the road.
\verse And \textit{when he} heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
\verse And many \textit{people} warned him that he should be quiet. But he was crying out \textit{even more loudly}, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
\verse And Jesus stopped \textit{and} said, “Call him.” And they called the blind man \textit{and} said to him, “Have courage! Get up! He is calling you.”
\verse And he threw off his cloak, jumped up, \textit{and} came to Jesus.
\verse And Jesus answered him \textit{and} said, “What do you want \textit{me to do} for you?” And the blind man said to him, “\textit{Rabboni}, that I may regain \textit{my} sight.”
\verse And Jesus said to him, “Go, your faith has healed you.” And immediately he regained \textit{his} sight and began to follow him on the road.

\verseWithHeading{The Triumphal Entry} And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples
\verse and said to them, “Go into the village before you, and right away \textit{as you} enter into it you will find a colt tied, on which no one \textit{has} ever sat. Untie it and bring \textit{it}.
\verse And if anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say ‘The Lord has need of it, and will send it here again at once.’ ”
\verse And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it.
\verse And some of those who were standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?”
\verse So they told them, just as Jesus had said, and they allowed them \textit{to take it}.
\verse And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, and he sat on it.
\verse And many \textit{people} spread their cloaks on the road, and others \textit{spread} leafy branches \textit{they} had cut from the fields.
\verse And those who went ahead and those who were following were shouting,
\verse “Hosanna! 
Blessed \textit{is} the one who comes in the name of the Lord!
\verse And he went into Jerusalem to the temple, and \textit{after} looking around at everything, \textit{because} the hour was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
\verseWithHeading{A Barren Fig Tree Cursed} And on the next day \textit{as} they were departing from Bethany, he was hungry.
\verse And \textit{when he} saw from a distance a fig tree that had leaves, he went \textit{to see} if perhaps he would find anything on it. And \textit{when he} came up to it he found nothing except leaves, because it was not the season for figs.
\verse And he responded \textit{and} said to it, “Let no one eat fruit from you any more \textit{forever}!” And his disciples heard \textit{it}.
\verseWithHeading{The Cleansing of the Temple} And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered into the temple \textit{courts} \textit{and} began to drive out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple \textit{courts}, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those who were selling doves.
\verse And he did not permit anyone to carry objects through the temple \textit{courts}.
\verse And he began to teach and was saying to them, “Is it not written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer 
for all the nations,’
\verse but you have made it a cave of robbers!”
\verse And the chief priests and the scribes heard \textit{it}, and began considering how they could destroy him. For they were afraid of him because the whole crowd was astounded by his teaching.
\verseWithHeading{The Barren Fig Tree Withered} And \textit{as they} passed by early in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.
\verse And Peter remembered \textit{and} said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered!”
\verse And Jesus answered \textit{and} said to them, “Have faith in God!
\verse Truly I say to you that whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea!’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will happen, it will be \textit{done} for him.
\verse For this \textit{reason} I say to you, whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received \textit{it}, and it will be \textit{done} for you.
\verse And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive \textit{him}, so that your Father who \textit{is} in heaven will also forgive you your sins.”
\verseWithHeading{Jesus’ Authority Challenged} And they came again to Jerusalem. And \textit{as} he was walking in the temple \textit{courts}, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came up to him
\verse and said to him, “By what authority are you doing these \textit{things}, or who gave you this authority that you do these \textit{things}?”
\verse So Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question. Answer me and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these \textit{things}.
\verse The baptism of John—was \textit{it} from heaven or from men? Answer me!”
\verse And they began to discuss \textit{this} with one another, saying, “What should we say? If we say ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’
\verse But if we say, ‘From men’ ”—they were afraid of the crowd, because they all looked upon John \textit{as truly a prophet}.
\verse And they replied to Jesus saying, “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these \textit{things}.”

\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Tenant Farmers in the Vineyard} And he began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard, and put a fence \textit{around it}, and dug a trough for the winepress, and built a watchtower, and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey.
\verse And he sent a slave to the tenant farmers at the proper time, so that he could collect \textit{some} of the fruit of the vineyard from the tenant farmers.
\verse And they seized him \textit{and} beat \textit{him} and sent \textit{him} away empty-handed.
\verse And again he sent to them another slave, and that one they struck on the head and dishonored.
\verse And he sent another, and that one they killed. And \textit{he sent} many others, \textit{some} of whom they beat and \textit{some} of whom they killed.
\verse He had one more, a beloved son. Last \textit{of all} he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
\verse But those tenant farmers said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours!’
\verse And they seized \textit{and} killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.
\verse What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenant farmers and give the vineyard to others.
\verse Have you not read this scripture:
\verse ‘The stone which the builders rejected, 
this has become \textit{the cornerstone}.
\verse And they were seeking to arrest him, and they were afraid of the crowd, because they knew that he had told the parable with reference to them. And they left him \textit{and} went away.
\verseWithHeading{Paying Taxes to Caesar} And they sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him so that they could catch him unawares in a statement.
\verse And \textit{when they} came, they said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and \textit{you do not care what anyone thinks}, \textit{because you do not regard the opinion of people} but teach the way of God in truth. Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or should we not pay?”
\verse But \textit{because he} knew their hypocrisy, he said to them, “Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius so that I can look at \textit{it}!”
\verse So they brought \textit{one}. And he said to them, “Whose image and inscription \textit{is} this?” And they said to him, “Caesar’s.”
\verse And Jesus said to them, “Give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!” And they were utterly amazed at him.
\verseWithHeading{A Question About Marriage and the Resurrection} And Sadducees—who say there is no resurrection—came up to him and began to ask him, saying,
\verse “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if someone’s brother dies and he leaves behind a wife and does not leave a child, that his brother should take the wife and \textit{father} descendants for his brother.
\verse There were seven brothers, and the first took a wife. And \textit{when he} died, he did not leave descendants.
\verse And the second took her, and he died without leaving descendants. And the third likewise.
\verse And the seven did not leave descendants. Last of all the woman also died.
\verse In the resurrection, when they rise, \textit{whose} wife will she be? For the seven had her \textit{as} wife.
\verse Jesus said to them, “Are you not deceived because of this, \textit{because you} do not know the scriptures or the power of God?
\verse For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
\verse Now concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses \textit{in the passage about the bush} how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I \textit{am} the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’?
\verse He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You are very much mistaken!”
\verseWithHeading{The Greatest Commandment} And one of the scribes came up \textit{and} heard them debating. \textit{When he} saw that he answered them well, he asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?”
\verse Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Listen, Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
\verse And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.’
\verse The second \textit{is} this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”
\verse And the scribe said to him, “That is true, Teacher. You have said \textit{correctly} that he is one and there is no other except him.
\verse And to love him from your whole heart and from your whole understanding and from your whole strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
\verse And Jesus, \textit{when he} saw that he had answered thoughtfully, said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And no one dared to put a question to him any longer.
\verseWithHeading{David’s Son and Lord} And continuing, Jesus said \textit{while} teaching in the temple \textit{courts}, “How can the scribes say that the Christ is David’s son?
\verse David himself said by the Holy Spirit, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, 
“Sit at my right hand, 
until I put your enemies 
under your feet.” ’
\verse David himself calls him ‘Lord,’ and how is he his son?” And the large crowd was listening to him gladly.
\verseWithHeading{Warning to Beware of the Scribes} And in his teaching he said, “Beware of the scribes, who like walking around in long robes and greetings in the marketplaces
\verse and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets,
\verse who devour the houses of widows and pray lengthy \textit{prayers} for the sake of appearance. These will receive more severe condemnation!”
\verseWithHeading{A Poor Widow’s Offering} And he sat down opposite the contribution box \textit{and} was observing how the crowd was putting coins into the contribution box. And many rich people were putting in many \textit{coins}.
\verse And one poor widow came \textit{and} put in two small copper coins (that is, a penny).
\verse And summoning his disciples, he said to them, “Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all those who put \textit{offerings} into the contribution box.
\verse For they all \textit{contributed} out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in everything she had, her whole means of subsistence.”

\verseWithHeading{The Destruction of the Temple Predicted} And \textit{as} he was going out of the temple \textit{courts}, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, look! What great stones and what wonderful buildings!”
\verse And Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? Not \textit{one} stone will be left here on \textit{another} stone that will not be thrown down!”
\verseWithHeading{Signs of the End of the Age} And \textit{as} he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
\verse “Tell us, when will these \textit{things} happen, and what \textit{will be} the sign when all these \textit{things} are about to be accomplished?”
\verse So Jesus began to say to them, “Watch out that no one deceives you!
\verse Many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am \textit{he},’ and they will deceive many.
\verse And when you hear about wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. This must happen, but the end \textit{is} not yet.
\verse For nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in \textit{various} places. There will be famines. These \textit{things} \textit{are} the beginning of birth pains.
\verseWithHeading{Persecution of Disciples Predicted} “But you, watch out for yourselves! They will hand you over to councils and you will be beaten in the synagogues and will have to stand before governors and kings because of me, for a witness to them.
\verse And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations.
\verse And when they arrest you \textit{and} hand you over, do not be anxious beforehand what you should say, but whatever is given to you at that hour, say this. For you are not the ones who are speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
\verse And brother will hand over brother to death, and a father \textit{his} child, and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.
\verse And you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end—this one will be saved.
\verseWithHeading{The Abomination of Desolation} “But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be” (let the one who reads understand), “then those in Judea must flee to the mountains!
\verse The one who is on his housetop must not come down or go inside to take anything out of his house,
\verse and the one who is in the field must not turn back to pick up his cloak.
\verse And woe to those \textit{who are pregnant} and to those who are nursing \textit{their babies} in those days!
\verse But pray that it will not happen in winter.
\verse For \textit{in} those days there will be tribulation of such a kind as has not happened from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, and never will happen.
\verse And if the Lord had not shortened the days, \textit{no human being would be saved}. But for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he has shortened the days.
\verse “And at that time if anyone should say to you, “Behold, here \textit{is} the Christ,’ ‘Behold, there \textit{he is},’ do not believe \textit{him}!
\verse For false messiahs and false prophets will appear, and will produce signs and wonders in order to mislead, if possible, the elect.
\verse But you, watch out! I have told you everything ahead of time!
\verseWithHeading{The Arrival of the Son of Man} “But in those days, after that tribulation,
\verse ‘the sun will be darkened 
and the moon will not give its light,
\verse And then they will see the Son of Man arriving in the clouds with great power and glory.
\verse And then he will send out the angels, and will gather the elect together from the four winds, from the end of the earth to the end of heaven.
\verseWithHeading{The Parable of the Fig Tree} “Now learn the parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.
\verse So also you, when you see these \textit{things} happening, know that he is near, at the door.
\verse Truly I say to you that this generation will never pass away until all these \textit{things} take place!
\verse Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
\verseWithHeading{The Unknown Day and Hour} “But concerning that day or hour no one knows—not even the angels in heaven nor the Son—except the Father.
\verse Watch out! Be alert, because you do not know when the time is!
\verse It is like a man away on a journey, who left his house and gave his slaves authority—to each one his work—and to the doorkeeper he gave orders that he should be on the alert.
\verse Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming—whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or early in the morning—
\verse lest he arrive suddenly \textit{and} find you sleeping.
\verse And what I say to you, I say to everyone: Be on the alert!”

\verseWithHeading{The Chief Priests and Scribes Plot to Kill Jesus} Now after two days it was the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread, and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how, \textit{after} arresting him by stealth, they could kill \textit{him}.
\verse For they said, “Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar by the people.”
\verseWithHeading{Jesus’ Anointing at Bethany} And \textit{while} he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, \textit{as} he was reclining for a meal, a woman came holding an alabaster flask of very costly perfumed oil of genuine nard. \textit{After} breaking the alabaster flask, she poured \textit{it} out on his head.
\verse But some were expressing indignation to one another: “Why has there been this waste of perfumed oil?
\verse For this perfumed oil could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor!” And they began to scold her.
\verse But Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why do you cause trouble for her? She has done a good deed to me.
\verse For the poor you always have with you, and you can do good for them whenever you want, but you do not always have me.
\verse She has done what she could; \textit{she has anointed my body beforehand} for burial.
\verse And truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.
\verseWithHeading{Judas Arranges to Betray Jesus} And Judas Iscariot, who \textit{was} one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them.
\verse And \textit{when} they heard \textit{this}, they were delighted, and promised to give him money. And he began seeking how he could betray him conveniently.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus’ Final Passover with the Disciples} And on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, “Where do you want us to go \textit{and} prepare, so that you can eat the Passover?”
\verse And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him,
\verse and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’
\verse And he will show you a large upstairs room furnished \textit{and} ready, and prepare for us there.”
\verse And the disciples went out and came into the city and found \textit{everything} just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
\verse And \textit{when it} was evening, he arrived with the twelve.
\verse And \textit{while} they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, that one of you who is eating with me will betray me.”
\verse They began to be distressed and to say to him one by one, “Surely not I?”
\verse But he said to them, “\textit{It is} one of the twelve—the one who is dipping \textit{bread} into the bowl with me.
\verse For the Son of Man is going just as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! \textit{It would be} better for him if that man had not been born.”
\verseWithHeading{The Lord’s Supper} And \textit{while} they were eating, he took bread \textit{and}, \textit{after} giving thanks, he broke \textit{it} and gave \textit{it} to them and said, “Take \textit{it}, this is my body.”
\verse And \textit{after} taking the cup \textit{and} giving thanks, he gave \textit{it} to them, and they all drank from it.
\verse And he said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many.
\verse Truly I say to you that I will never drink of the fruit of the vine any longer until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”
\verse And \textit{after they} had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial} And Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away, because it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd 
and the sheep will be scattered.’
\verse But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”
\verse But Peter said to him, “Even if they all fall away, certainly I will not!”
\verse And Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you that today—this night—before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times!”
\verse But he kept saying emphatically, “If it is necessary for me to die with you, I will never deny you!” And they all were saying the same \textit{thing} also.
\verseWithHeading{The Prayer in Gethsemane} And they came to a place \textit{named} Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”
\verse And he took along Peter and James and John with him, and he began to be distressed and troubled.
\verse And he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake.”
\verse And going forward a little he fell to the ground and began to pray that, if it were possible, the hour would pass from him.
\verse And he said, “Abba, Father, all \textit{things} \textit{are} possible for you! Take away this cup from me! Yet not what I will, but what you \textit{will}.”
\verse And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “Simon, are you sleeping? Were you not able to stay awake one hour?
\verse Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit \textit{is} willing, but the flesh \textit{is} weak!”
\verse And again he went away \textit{and} prayed, saying the same thing.
\verse And again he came \textit{and} found them sleeping, \textit{for they could not keep their eyes open}, and they did not know what to reply to him.
\verse And he came the third \textit{time} and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough! The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\verse Get up, let us go! Behold, the one who is betraying me is approaching!”
\verseWithHeading{The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus} And immediately, \textit{while} he was still speaking, Judas—one of the twelve—arrived, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
\verse Now the one who was betraying him had given them a sign, saying, “\textit{The one} whom I kiss—he is \textit{the one}. Arrest him and lead \textit{him} away under guard!”
\verse And \textit{when he} arrived, he came up to him immediately \textit{and} said, “Rabbi,” and kissed him.
\verse So they laid hands on him and arrested him.
\verse But a certain one of the bystanders, drawing \textit{his} sword, struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.
\verse And Jesus answered \textit{and} said to them, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber, to arrest me?
\verse Every day I was with you in the temple \textit{courts} teaching, and you did not arrest me! But \textit{this has happened} in order that the scriptures would be fulfilled.
\verse And they all abandoned him \textit{and} fled.
\verse And a certain young man was following him, clothed \textit{only} in a linen cloth on \textit{his} naked body. And they attempted to seize him,
\verse but he left behind the linen cloth \textit{and} fled naked.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Before the Sanhedrin} And they led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together.
\verse And Peter followed him from a distance, right inside, into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with the officers and warming himself by the fire.
\verse Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, and they did not find \textit{it}.
\verse For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony was not consistent.
\verse And some stood up \textit{and} began to give false testimony against him, saying,
\verse “We heard him saying, ‘I will destroy this temple made by hands, and within three days I will build another not made by hands.”
\verse And their testimony was not even consistent about this.
\verse And the high priest stood up in the midst \textit{of them} \textit{and} asked Jesus, saying, “Do you not reply anything? What are these \textit{people} testifying against you?”
\verse But he was silent and did not reply anything. Again the high priest asked him and said to him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”
\verse And Jesus said, “I am, and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.”
\verse And the high priest tore his clothes \textit{and} said, “What further need do we have of witnesses?
\verse You have heard the blasphemy! What \textit{do you think}?” And they all condemned him \textit{as deserving death}.
\verse And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him with their fists, and to say to him “Prophesy!” And the officers received him with slaps in the face.
\verseWithHeading{Peter Denies Jesus Three Times} And \textit{while} Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the female slaves of the high priest came up
\verse And \textit{when} she saw Peter warming himself, she looked intently at him \textit{and} said, “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”
\verse But he denied \textit{it}, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you mean!” And he went out into the gateway, and a rooster crowed.
\verse And the female slave, \textit{when she} saw him, began to say again to the bystanders, “This man is one of them!”
\verse But he denied \textit{it} again. And after a little \textit{while}, again the bystanders began to say to Peter, “You really are \textit{one} of them, because you also are a Galilean, and your accent \textit{shows it}!”
\verse And he began to curse and to swear with an oath, “I do not know this man whom you are talking about!”
\verse And immediately a rooster crowed for the second time. And Peter remembered the statement, how Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times,” and throwing himself down, he began to weep.

\verseWithHeading{Jesus Taken to Pilate} And as soon as morning \textit{came}, \textit{after} formulating a plan, the chief priests, with the elders and scribes and the whole Sanhedrin, tied up Jesus, led \textit{him} away, and handed \textit{him} over to Pilate.
\verse And Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” And he answered him \textit{and} said, “You say \textit{so}.”
\verse And the chief priests began to accuse him \textit{of} many \textit{things}.
\verse So Pilate asked him again, saying, “Do you not answer anything? See how many \textit{charges} they are bringing against you!”
\verse But Jesus did not answer anything further, so that Pilate was astonished.
\verseWithHeading{Pilate Releases Barabbas} Now at each feast he customarily released for them one prisoner whom they requested.
\verse And the one named Barabbas was imprisoned with the rebels who had committed murder in the rebellion.
\verse And the crowd came up \textit{and} began to ask him to do as he customarily did for them.
\verse So Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?”
\verse (For he realized that the chief priests had handed him over because of envy.)
\verse But the chief priests incited the crowd so that he would release for them Barabbas instead.
\verse So Pilate answered \textit{and} said to them again, “Then what do you want me to do with \textit{the one} whom you call the king of the Jews?”
\verse And they shouted again, “Crucify him!”
\verse And Pilate said to them, “Why? What evil has he done?” But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!”
\verse So Pilate, \textit{because he} wanted \textit{to satisfy} the crowd, released for them Barabbas. And \textit{after} he had Jesus flogged, he handed \textit{him} over so that he could be crucified.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Is Mocked} So the soldiers led him away into the palace (that is, the governor’s residence) and called together the whole cohort.
\verse And they put a purple cloak on him, and \textit{after} weaving a crown of thorns they placed \textit{it} on him.
\verse And they began to greet him, “Hail, king of the Jews!”
\verse And they repeatedly struck him on the head with a reed, and were spitting on him, and \textit{they knelt down} \textit{and} did obeisance to him.
\verse And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him, and they led him out so that they could crucify him.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Is Crucified} And they forced a certain man who was passing by, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), who was coming from the country, to carry his cross.
\verse And they brought him to the place \textit{Golgotha} (which is translated “Place of a Skull”).
\verse And they attempted to give him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
\verse And they crucified him and divided his clothes among themselves \textit{by} casting lots for them \textit{to see} who should take what.
\verse Now it was the third hour when they crucified him.
\verse And the inscription of the charge against him was written, “The king of the Jews.”
\verse And with him they crucified two robbers, one on \textit{his} right and one on \textit{his} left.
\verse And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild \textit{it} in three days,
\verse save yourself \textit{by} coming down from the cross!”
\verse In the same way also the chief priests, along with the scribes, were mocking \textit{him} to one another, saying, “He saved others; he is not able to save himself!
\verse Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe! Even those who were crucified with him were reviling him.
\verseWithHeading{Jesus Dies on the Cross} And \textit{when} the sixth hour came, darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
\verse And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “\textit{Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?}” (which is translated, “My God, my God, \textit{why} have you forsaken me?”)
\verse And some of the bystanders, \textit{when they} heard \textit{it}, said, “Behold, he is summoning Elijah!”
\verse And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put \textit{it} on a reed, \textit{and} gave \textit{it} to him to drink, saying, “Leave \textit{him} alone! Let us see if Elijah is coming to take him down.”
\verse But Jesus uttered a loud cry \textit{and} expired.
\verse And the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
\verse And \textit{when} the centurion who was standing opposite him saw that he expired like this, he said, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”
\verse And there were also women observing from a distance, among whom \textit{were} Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and Joses, and Salome,
\verse who used to follow him and serve him when he was in Galilee, and many other \textit{women} who went up with him to Jerusalem.

\verse Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the council who was also himself looking forward to the kingdom of God, came acting courageously \textit{and} went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
\verse And Pilate was surprised that he was already dead, and summoning the centurion, asked him whether he had died already.
\verse And \textit{when he} learned of \textit{it} from the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.
\verse And \textit{after} purchasing a linen cloth \textit{and} taking him down, he wrapped \textit{him} in the linen cloth and placed him in a tomb that had been cut from the rock. And he rolled a stone over the entrance of the tomb.

\verseWithHeading{Jesus Is Raised} And \textit{when} the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the \textit{mother} of James, and Salome purchased fragrant spices so that they could go \textit{and} anoint him.
\verse And very early in the morning on the first \textit{day} of the week they came to the tomb \textit{after} the sun had risen.
\verse And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”
\verse And \textit{when they} looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away (for it was very large).
\verse And \textit{as they} were going into the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.
\verse But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified. He has been raised, he is not here! See the place where they laid him!
\verse But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.”
\verse And they went out \textit{and} fled from the tomb, because trembling and amazement had seized them. And they said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid. \textit{So they promptly reported all the \textit{things} they had been commanded to those around Peter. And after these \textit{things}, Jesus himself also sent out through them from the east even as far as the west the holy and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation. Amen.}
\verseWithHeading{The Longer Ending of Mark} \textit{Now early on the first \textit{day} of the week, \textit{after he} rose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had expelled seven demons.

\verse And those, \textit{when they} heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, refused to believe \textit{it}.
\verse And after these \textit{things}, he appeared in a different form to two of them \textit{as they} were walking, \textit{while they} were going out into the countryside.
\verse And these went \textit{and} reported \textit{it} to the others, and they did not believe them.
\verse And later, \textit{while} they were reclining at table, he appeared to the eleven. And he reprimanded their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him \textit{after he} had been raised.
\verse And he said to them, “Go into all the world \textit{and} preach the gospel to all creation.
\verse The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who refuses to believe will be condemned.
\verse And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will expel demons, they will speak in new tongues,
\verse they will pick up snakes. And if they drink any deadly \textit{poison} it will never hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick and \textit{they will get} well.”
\verse Then the Lord Jesus, after \textit{he} had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.
\verse And they went out \textit{and} proclaimed everywhere, \textit{while} the Lord was working together with \textit{them} and confirming the message through the accompanying signs.}
