\verseWithHeading{Greeting}{Simeon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a faith equal in value to ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.}%
\verse{May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,}%
\verse{because his divine power has bestowed on us all things that are necessary for life and godliness, through the knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence of character,}%

\verse{and with knowledge, self-control, and with self-control, patient endurance, and with patient endurance, godliness,}%
\verse{and with godliness, brotherly love, and with brotherly love, love.}%
\verseWithHeading{Make Your Calling and Election Secure}{For if\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “if” is supplied as a component of the participle (“are”) which is understood as conditional}these things are yours and are increasing, this does not make you useless or unproductive in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.}%
\verse{For the one for whom these things are not present is blind, being nearsighted, \textit{having forgotten the cleansing}\lebnote{Literally “receiving forgetfulness of the cleansing”}of his former sins.}%
\verse{Therefore, brothers, be zealous even more to make your calling and election secure, because if you\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “if” is supplied as a component of the participle (“do”) which is understood as conditional}do these things, you will never ever stumble.}%
\verse{For in this way entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly supplied for you.}%

\verse{But I consider it right, for as long as I am in this habitation, to stir you up by a reminder,}%
\verse{because I\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “because” is supplied as a component of the participle (“know”) which is understood as causal}know that the removal of my habitation is imminent, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.}%
\verse{And I will also make every effort that you are able at any time, after my departure, \textit{to recall these things to mind}\lebnote{Literally “to make recollection of these”}.}%
\verseWithHeading{The Reliable Prophetic Word of Testimony}{For we did not make known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ by\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “by” is supplied as a component of the participle (“following”) which is understood as means}following ingeniously concocted myths, but by\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “by” is supplied as a component of the participle (“being”) which is understood as means}being eyewitnesses of that one’s majesty.}%
\verse{For he received honor and glory from God the Father when\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “when” is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle (“was brought”)}a voice such as this was brought to him by the Majestic Glory, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”}%

\verse{recognizing this above all, that every prophecy of scripture does not come about from one’s own interpretation,}%
\verse{for no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men carried along by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.}%

\begin{biblechapter} % 2 Peter 2
\verseWithHeading{The Rise and Fall of the False Teachers}{But there were also false prophets among the people, as there will be false teachers among you also, who will bring in \textit{destructive heresies}\lebnote{Literally “heresies of destruction”}, even denying the Master who bought them, thus\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “thus” is supplied as a component of the participle (“bringing on”) which is understood as result}bringing on themselves swift destruction.}%
\verse{And many will follow their licentious ways, because of whom the way of truth will be reviled.}%

\verse{For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but held them captive in Tartarus with chains of darkness and handed them over to be kept for judgment,}%
\verse{and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a proclaimer of righteousness, \textit{and seven others}\lebnote{Literally “eighth”}when he\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “when” is supplied as a component of the participle (“brought”) which is understood as temporal}brought a flood on the world of the ungodly,}%
\verse{and condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction, reducing them to ashes, having appointed them as an example for those who are going to be ungodly,}%
\verse{and rescued righteous Lot, worn down by the way of life of lawless persons in licentiousness}%
\verse{(for that righteous man, as he\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “as” is supplied as a component of the participle (“lived”) which is understood as temporal}lived among them day after day, was tormenting his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he was seeing and hearing),}%
\verse{then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to reserve the unrighteous to be punished at\lebnote{Or “until”}the day of judgment,}%
\verse{and especially those who go after the flesh in defiling lust\lebnote{Literally “in lust of defilement,” translated here as an attributive genitive}and who despise authority.}%

\verse{whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, do not bring against them a demeaning judgment.\lebnote{Some manuscripts have “a demeaning judgment from the Lord”}}%
\verse{But these persons, like irrational animals born only with natural instincts for capture and killing, blaspheming \textit{about things}\lebnote{Literally “with reference to which”}they do not understand, in their destruction will also be destroyed,}%
\verse{being harmed as the wages of unrighteousness. Considering reveling in the daytime a pleasure, they are stains and blemishes, carousing in their deceitful pleasures when they\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “when” is supplied as a component of the participle (“feast together”) which is understood as temporal}feast together with you,}%
\verse{having eyes full of desire for an adulteress and unceasing from sin, enticing unstable persons, and\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “and” is supplied in keeping with English style}having hearts trained for greediness. Accursed children!}%
\verse{By\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “by” is supplied as a component of the participle (“leaving”) which is understood as means}leaving the straight path, they have gone astray, because they\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “because” is supplied as a component of the participle (“followed”) which is understood as causal}followed the way of Balaam the son of Bosor,\lebnote{Although some English versions use “Beor” here, this is due to harmonization with the Old Testament; the vast majority of Greek manuscripts read “Bosor” here}who loved the wages of unrighteousness,}%
\verse{These people are waterless springs and mists driven by a hurricane, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved.}%
\verse{\textit{For by speaking high-sounding but empty words}\lebnote{Literally “for speaking pompous words of emptiness”}, they entice with desires of the flesh and with licentiousness those who are scarcely escaping from those who live in error,}%
\verse{promising them freedom although they\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “although” is supplied as a component of the participle (“are”) which is understood as concessive}themselves are slaves of depravity. For to whatever someone succumbs, by this he is also\lebnote{Some manuscripts omit “also”}enslaved.}%
\verse{For if, after they\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “after” is supplied as a component of the participle (“have escaped from”) which is understood as temporal}have escaped from the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord\lebnote{Some manuscripts have “of our Lord”}and Savior Jesus Christ, and they are again entangled in these things and succumb to them, the last state has become worse for them than the first.}%
\verse{For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment that had been delivered to them.}%
\verse{The statement of the true proverb has happened to them, “A dog returns to its own vomit,”\lebnote{A paraphrased quotation from Prov 26:11}and “A sow, after\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*Here “after” is supplied as a component of the participle (“washing herself”) which is understood as temporal}washing herself, returns\lebnote{:|NP|:﻿*The verb “returns” is not in the Greek text, but is an understood repetition from the previous clause}to wallowing in the mud.”\lebnote{The source of this quotation is uncertain}}%

\verse{and saying, “Where is the promise of his coming? For \textit{ever since}\lebnote{Literally “from which time”}the fathers fell asleep, all things have continued just as they have been from the beginning of creation.”}%

\verse{And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as also our dear brother Paul wrote to you, according to the wisdom that was given to him,}%
