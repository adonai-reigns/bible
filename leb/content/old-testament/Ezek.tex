\verseWithHeading{Date of Vision of Living Creatures and Glory of the Throne of Adonai}{And it was in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, and I was in the midst of\lebnote{Or “among”} the exiles\lebnote{Hebrew “exile”} by the Kebar River.\lnCGR{} The heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.}%
\verse{On the fifth day of the month — it was the fifth year of the exile of the king Jehoiachin —}%
\verse{the word of Adonai came\lebnote{“was”} clearly\lebnote{Or “certainly”} to Ezekiel the son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans at the Kebar River,\lnCGR{} and the hand of Adonai was on him there.}%
\verse{And I looked,\lebnote{Or “saw”} and look! A storm wind was coming from the north, a great cloud, and fire flashing back and forth, and brightness around and within it,\lebnote{“for it”} and from its midst\lnCGS{} it was like the outward appearance of amber stone from the midst\lnCGS{} of the fire.}%
\verse{And from its midst\lnCGS{} was the likeness of four living creatures, and this was their appearance: a human form,\lebnote{“this their appearance the likeness of a human to them”}}%
\verse{and each had four faces,\lebnote{“and four faces to each”} and each of them had four wings.\lebnote{“and four wings to each for them”}}%
\verse{And their legs were straight legs, and the sole of their feet was like the sole of the foot of a calf, and they were sparkling like the outward appearance of polished bronze.}%
\verse{And under their wings were human hands\lebnote{“hand his a man”} on their four sides. And their faces and their wings for the four of them were as follows:}%
\verse{their wings were touching one another;\lebnote{“their wings \textit{were} touching each her sister”} each of them went straight forward,\lnCGT{} without turning right or left.\lebnote{“each toward the side of his face they went”}}%
\verse{The likeness of their faces was the face of a human in front, and the face of a lion on the right of each of them,\lnCGU{} and the face of an ox on the left of each of them,\lnCGU{} and the face of an eagle for each of them.\lnCGU{}}%
\verse{So were their faces; their wings were spread out upward;\lnCGV{} each had two touching one another and two covering their bodies.}%
\verse{And each went straight forward;\lebnote{“toward the side of his face they went”} wherever the spirit went\lebnote{“towards which it was there the spirit”} they went, and they did not turn as they went.\lnCGT{}}%
\verse{As for\lnCGW{} the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. It\lebnote{That is, the fire} was moving to and fro between the living creatures, and the fire was very bright\lebnote{“brightness \textit{was} for the fire”} and lightning was going out from the fire.}%
\verse{And the living creatures were speeding to and fro\lebnote{“sped forth and returned”} like the appearance of lightning.}%
\verse{And I saw the living creatures, and look! A wheel was on the earth\lnCGX{} beside each of the living creatures that had four faces.\lebnote{“the living creatures for the four of his/its faces.” The LXX has “for the four of them.”}}%
\verse{The appearance of the wheels and their construction was like the appearance of beryl,\lebnote{Or “chrysolite,” or “topaz”; this stone is difficult to identify exactly} and they all looked alike,\lebnote{“likeness \textit{was} one for the four of them”} and their appearance and their construction was like a wheel within a wheel.\lebnote{“as that it was a wheel in the midst of a wheel”}}%
\verse{When they moved, they went toward their four sides; they did not veer at all as they went.\lebnote{“turn away when they went”}}%
\verse{And their rims were high and awesome,\lebnote{“height \textit{was} for them and awesomeness \textit{was} for them”} and all four of\lnCGU{} their rims were full of eyes all around.}%
\verse{And at the going of the living creatures, the wheels next to them also went, and when the creatures were lifted from the ground\lebnote{“and at the lifting up of the creatures from the earth”} the wheels also rose.}%
\verse{Wherever\lebnote{“Toward which”} the spirit went they would go there, and the wheels rose, for the spirit of the living creatures\lnCGY{} was in the wheels.}%
\verse{At their\lebnote{That is, the living creatures} going, they\lebnote{That is, the wheels} go, and at their standing, they stood, and at their being lifted up from on the earth,\lnCGX{} the wheels rose,\lebnote{Or “were lifted up”} for the spirit of the living creatures\lnCGY{} was in the wheels.}%
\verse{Now\lnCGW{} the likeness above the heads of the living creatures was an expanse like the outward appearance of awesome\lebnote{“terrible”} ice\lebnote{“frozen water”} spread out above their heads upward.\lebnote{“from to upward”}}%
\verse{And under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight one toward the other;\lebnote{“each towards its sister”} each had two wings covering them, and each had two wings covering their bodies.}%
\verse{And I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the voice of Shaddai,\lebnote{Often translated “Almighty”} and when they moved\lebnote{“at their going”} there was a sound of tumult like the sound of an army; when they stood still\lnCGZ{} they lowered their wings.}%
\verse{And there was\lebnote{Or “it was”} a sound from above the expanse that was above their heads, and when they stood\lnCGZ{} they lowered their wings.}%
\verse{And from above the expanse that was above their heads there was the likeness of a throne, looking like a sapphire,\lebnote{“\textit{the} appearance of a stone of sapphire”} and above the likeness of the throne was a likeness similar to\lebnote{Or “like”} the appearance of a human on it, but above it.\lnCGV{}}%
\verse{And I saw something like the outward appearance of amber, something like the appearance of fire, with a covering around it, from the likeness of his loins and upward.\lebnote{“to above”} And from the likeness of his loins and downward\lebnote{“to down”} I saw something like the appearance of fire, and it was radiant all around.\lebnote{“brightness \textit{was} for it around”}}%
\verse{Like the appearance\lebnote{Or “likeness”} of a bow that is in the cloud on a rainy day,\lebnote{“the day of the rain”} such was the radiance\lebnote{Or “brightness”} around it; thus was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Adonai. And I saw, and I fell on my face, and I heard a voice speaking.}%
