\verseWithHeading{Joshua Addresses the Israelites}{After the death of Moses the servant of Adonai, Adonai said to Joshua son of Nun, the assistant\lebnote{Or “servant”} of Moses, saying,}%
\verse{“My servant Moses is dead. Get up and cross the Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the Israelites.\lebnote{“sons/children of Israel”}}%
\verse{Every place that the soles of your feet will tread, I have given it to you, as I promised\lebnote{Or “spoke”} to Moses.}%
\verse{From the wilderness and the Lebanon,\lebnote{“this Lebanon”; “Lebanon” in Hebrew means “white mountain”} up to the great river, the river Euphrates, all of the land of the Hittites, and up to the great sea in the west,\lebnote{“the great sea of the setting sun”} will be your territory.}%
\verse{No one will stand before you\lebnote{Or “in your presence”} all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses, so will I be with you; I will not fail you, and I will not forsake you.}%
\verse{Be strong and courageous, for you will give the people this land as an inheritance that I swore to their ancestors\lebnote{Or “fathers”} to give them.}%
\verse{Only be strong and very courageous to observe diligently the whole law\lebnote{“to keep \textit{and} to act according to the whole law”} that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn aside from it, to the right or left, so that you may succeed wherever you go.\lnBAA{}}%
\verse{The scroll of this law will not depart from your mouth; you will meditate on it day and night so that you may observe diligently all that is written\lebnote{“to keep \textit{and} to act according to all that is written”} in it. For then you will succeed in your ways and prosper.}%
\verse{Did I not command you? Be strong and courageous! Do not fear or be dismayed, for Adonai your God is with you wherever you go.”\lnBAA{}}%
\verse{Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,}%
\verse{“Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people: ‘Prepare your provisions;\lebnote{Hebrew “provision”} in\lebnote{“for in still”} three days you are to cross the Jordan to go possess the land that Adonai your God is giving you to possess.’”}%
\verse{To the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua said,}%
\verse{“Remember the word that Moses Adonai’s servant commanded you, saying, ‘Adonai your God is giving rest to you, and he is giving\lebnote{Hebrew “he gave”} you this land.’}%
\verse{Your wives, your little children, and your livestock, they will remain in the land that Moses gave to you beyond the Jordan. All of the best fighting men\lebnote{“All the mighty warriors of the troop”} will cross armed in front of your families; they will help you}%
\verse{until Adonai gives rest to your families as well as to you. They will take possession of the land that Adonai your God is giving to them. Then you will return to your own land and take possession of it, the land that Moses the servant of Adonai gave you beyond the Jordan to the east.”\lebnote{“to the sunrise”}}%
\verse{And they answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you will send us we will go.}%
\verse{Just as we obeyed Moses, so will we obey you. Only may Adonai your God be with you, as he was with Moses.}%
\verse{Whoever rebels against your orders\lebnote{“defiles against your mouth”} and does not obey your words according to what you commanded us will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.”}%

\begin{biblechapter}% Joshua 2
\verseWithHeading{Spies View the Land}{Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two men from Acacia Grove\lebnote{Hebrew “Shittim”} as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” So they went, and entered the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and spent the night\lebnote{“lay down”} there.}%
\verse{The king of Jericho was told, “Look, some men from the Israelites\lebnote{“sons/children of Israel”} have come here tonight to search out the land.”}%
\verse{And the king of Jericho sent for Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who came to you, the ones who have entered your house, for they have come to search out the whole land.”}%
\verse{But the woman took the two men and hid them. And she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from.}%
\verse{And when it was time to shut the gate for the night,\lebnote{“in the darkness” or “at dark”} the men left, and I do not know where they went. Chase after them quickly, for you may catch up to them.”}%
\verse{(But she had taken them to the roof and had hidden them in the stalks of flax\lebnote{“in the flaxes of the plant stalk”} that she had spread out\lebnote{“had been arranged”} on the roof.)}%
\verse{So the men chased after them on the way to the Jordan\lebnote{“the road of the Jordan”} at the fords; and they shut the gate behind the pursuers that had gone out after them.}%
\verse{Before they went to sleep,\lebnote{“they lay down”} she came up to them on the roof}%
\verse{and said to the men, “I know that Adonai has given you the land, and that dread of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away in fear because of your presence.}%
\verse{For we have heard how Adonai dried up the waters of the Red Sea\lebnote{“sea of reeds”} before you when you went out from Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.}%
\verse{We heard this, and our hearts\lebnote{Hebrew “heart”} melted, and no courage was left in anyone\lebnote{“a spirit no longer stood in anyone”} because of your presence. For Adonai your God is God in the heavens above and on the earth below.}%
\verse{So then please swear to me by Adonai, because I have shown loyalty to you,\lebnote{“I have done with you a loyal love”} and you will also show loyalty\lebnote{“you will do … loyal love”} to my family.\lebnote{“with the house of my father”} You must give me a sign of good faith,\lebnote{Or “faithfulness”}}%
\verse{and you will spare my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all that belongs to them; you will deliver our lives from death.”}%
\verse{And the men said to her, “Our lives for yours.\lebnote{“Our lives in place of yours to die”} If you do not report this business of ours, we will show you loyalty and faithfulness\lebnote{“we will do with you loyal love and faithfulness”} when Adonai gives us the land.”}%
\verse{Then she lowered them with a rope through the window, as her house was on the outer side of the wall, and she was residing in the wall.}%
\verse{And she said to them, “Go to the mountain, so that the pursuers will not find you, and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers return, and afterward you may go on your way.”\lebnote{“to your way”}}%
\verse{The men said to her, “We will be released from this oath of yours that you made us swear.}%
\verse{When we come to the land, you must tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and you must gather your father and mother, and your brothers, and your whole family to your house.}%
\verse{If anyone goes outside the doors of your house, they will be responsible for their own death,\lebnote{“his blood \textit{will be} on his head”} and we will be innocent. Anyone who will be with you in the house, we will be responsible for their death\lebnote{“his blood \textit{will be} on our head”} if a hand is laid on them.\lebnote{“if a hand will be against him”}}%
\verse{But if you report this business of ours, we will be released from your oath that you made us swear.”}%
\verse{And she said, “According to your word it will be.” Then she sent them away, and they went, and she tied the scarlet cord in the window.}%
\verse{They departed and came to the mountain, and they stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers searched all along the way\lebnote{“on all of the road”} but did not find them.}%
\verse{The two men returned and went down from the mountain, and they crossed over and came to Joshua son of Nun, and they told him everything that happened to them.}%
\verse{They said to Joshua, “Surely Adonai has given all the land into our hand; also, all the inhabitants of the land melt away in fear because of our presence.”}%

\begin{biblechapter}% Joshua 3
\verseWithHeading{The Israelites Cross the Jordan}{Joshua rose early in the morning, and they set out from Acacia Grove.\lebnote{Hebrew “Shittim”} And they came up to the Jordan, he and all the Israelites,\lnBAB{} and they spent the night there before they crossed over.}%
\verse{At the end of the three days the officers passed through the midst of the camp,}%
\verse{and they commanded the people: “When you see the Levitical priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Adonai your God you must set out from your place and go after it.}%
\verse{But there will be a distance between you and it of about two thousand cubits in measurement.\lebnote{That is, about 1 km} Do not come near it, so that you may know the way that you must go, for you have not passed on this way before.”\lebnote{“from yesterday three days before”}}%
\verse{And Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves, because tomorrow Adonai will do wonders in your midst.”}%
\verse{And Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people.”\lnBAC{} And they took up the ark of the covenant and went ahead of the people.\lnBAC{}}%
\verse{Then Adonai said to Joshua, “This day I will begin exalting you in the sight\lebnote{“in the eyes”} of all Israel, that they may know that I was with Moses, and I will be with you.}%
\verse{You will command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘At the moment that you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you will stand still in the Jordan.’”}%
\verse{And Joshua said to the Israelites,\lnBAB{} “Come here, and hear the words of Adonai your God.”}%
\verse{Joshua said, “By this you will know that the living God is in your midst, and he will certainly drive out the Canaanites from before you,\lebnote{Or “from your presence”} and the Hittites, Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites.}%
\verse{Look! The ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth\lnBAD{} is about to cross over ahead of you into the Jordan.}%
\verse{So then, take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.\lebnote{“one man for the tribe”}}%
\verse{When the soles of the feet of the priests carrying the ark of Adonai, Lord of all the earth,\lnBAD{} rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off upstream,\lebnote{“going down from above”} and they will stand still in one heap.}%
\verse{And it happened, when the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant were ahead of the people.\lnBAC{}}%
\verse{When those carrying the ark came up to the Jordan, and the priests carrying the ark dipped their feet in the edge of the water (the Jordan was flowing over its banks during all the days of harvest),}%
\verse{the waters flowing down from above stood still; they stood up in one heap very far from Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, while the waters flowing down to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea,\lebnote{That is, the Dead Sea} were completely cut off;\lebnote{“they were completed they were cut off”} and the people crossed over opposite Jericho.}%
\verse{And the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Adonai stood firmly on the dry land in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel crossed on dry ground, until all the nation finished crossing the Jordan.}%
\end{biblechapter}%
\begin{biblechapter}% Joshua 4
\verseWithHeading{The Israelites Make a Memorial}{After all the nation finished crossing the Jordan, Adonai said to Joshua,}%
\verse{“Take twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe,\lebnote{“man one man one from tribe”}}%
\verse{and command them, saying, ‘Take for yourselves twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan where the priests’ feet stood firmly, and bring them over with you, and set them up in the place where you will camp tonight.’”\lebnote{“the lodging place where you will lodge tonight”}}%
\verse{So Joshua summoned the twelve men whom he had appointed from the Israelites,\lnBAE{} one from each tribe.}%
\verse{And Joshua said to them, “Cross over before\lebnote{Or “the presence”} the ark of Adonai your God to the middle of the Jordan, and each one of you lift up a stone on your\lebnote{Hebrew “his”} shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites,\lnBAE{}}%
\verse{so that this may be a reminder\lebnote{Or “sign”} among you. When your children ask in the future, saying, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’\lebnote{“What are these stones for you?”}}%
\verse{you will say to them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off from before\lebnote{Or “the presence of”} the ark of the covenant of Adonai. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones will be as a memorial for the Israelites\lnBAE{} for eternity.”}%
\verse{Thus the Israelites\lnBAE{} did as Joshua commanded. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan as Adonai told Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites,\lnBAE{} and they carried them over with them to the camp,\lebnote{“the place of overnight lodging”} and they put them there.}%
\verse{Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests carrying the ark of the covenant stood, and they are there to this day.}%
\verse{The priests carrying the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything that Adonai commanded Joshua to tell the people was finished, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. And the people hastily crossed over.}%
\verse{And it happened, when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of Adonai and the priests crossed over in front of\lebnote{Or “before the presence”} the people.}%
\verse{The children of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the Israelites,\lnBAE{} as Moses told them.}%
\verse{About forty thousand armed for fighting crossed over before the presence of Adonai to the plains of Jericho for battle.}%
\verse{On that day Adonai exalted Joshua in the sight\lebnote{“in the eyes”} of all Israel, and they respected him\lebnote{Or “feared him”} as they respected\lebnote{Or “feared”} Moses all the days of his life.}%
\verse{Then Adonai said to Joshua, saying,}%
\verse{“Command the priests carrying the ark of the testimony\lebnote{That is, the ark of the covenant} to come up\lebnote{“and let them come up”} from the Jordan.”}%
\verse{So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.”}%
\verse{And it happened that when the priests carrying the ark came up from the middle of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet touched dry land,\lebnote{“were raised from the ground to dry land”} the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and flowed over all its banks as before.}%
\verse{And the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the eastern edge\lebnote{That is, border} of Jericho.}%
\verse{And those twelve stones that they took from the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.}%
\verse{And he said to the Israelites,\lnBAE{} “When your children ask in the future their parents,\lebnote{“their fathers”} ‘What is the meaning of these stones?’\lebnote{“What \textit{are} these stones?”}}%
\verse{you will let your children know by saying, ‘Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.’}%
\verse{For Adonai your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you, until you had crossed, just as Adonai your God did to the Red Sea,\lebnote{“sea of reeds”} which he dried up before us until we had crossed over,}%
\verse{so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of Adonai is strong, so that you may fear Adonai your God forever.”\lebnote{“all the days”}}%

\begin{biblechapter}% Joshua 5
\verseWithHeading{The Israelites Are Circumcised}{And it happened, when all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites\lebnote{Hebrew “Canaanite”} who were by the sea heard that Adonai dried up the waters of the Jordan in front of the Israelites\lnBAF{} until they crossed over, their hearts melted, and there was no courage left in them\lebnote{“a spirit was no longer in them”} because of the presence of the Israelites.\lnBAF{}}%
\verse{At that time Adonai said to Joshua, “Make for yourself knives of flint, and circumcise the Israelites\lnBAF{} a second time.”}%
\verse{So Joshua made knives of flint, and he circumcised the Israelites\lnBAF{} at the hill of the foreskins.\lebnote{Hebrew “Gibeath-haaraloth”}}%
\verse{This is the reason why Joshua circumcised all the people: all the males who went out from Egypt, all the warriors, died in the wilderness as they went out from Egypt on the journey.\lnBAG{}}%
\verse{For all the people who left were circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness on the journey\lnBAG{} after they left from Egypt were not circumcised.}%
\verse{For forty years the Israelites\lnBAF{} traveled in the wilderness until all the nation, the warriors that left Egypt, perished, because they did not listen to the voice of Adonai. To them Adonai swore that they would not see the land that he\lebnote{Hebrew “Adonai”} swore to their ancestors\lebnote{Or “fathers”} to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.}%
\verse{And it was their children whom he raised in their place that Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the journey.\lnBAG{}}%
\verseWithHeading{The Israelites Celebrate Passover in Canaan}{And it happened, when all the nation had finished circumcising, they remained where they were in the camp until they recovered.}%
\verse{And Adonai said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you.” Therefore, the name of that place is called Gilgal\lebnote{Hebrew “rolling”} to this day.}%
\verse{And the Israelites\lnBAF{} camped at Gilgal, and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, on the plains of Jericho.}%
\verse{On the next day after the Passover, on that\lebnote{“this”} very day, they ate from the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and roasted corn.}%
\verse{And the manna ceased the day after, when they started eating the produce of the land, and there was no longer manna for the Israelites.\lnBAF{} They ate from the crop of the land of Canaan in that year.}%
\verseWithHeading{The Commander of Adonai’s Army Appears Before Joshua}{And it happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, he looked up,\lebnote{“he lifted up his eyes”} and he saw a man standing opposite him\lebnote{“against him”} with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said, “Are you with us, or with our adversaries?”}%
\verse{And he said, “Neither. I have come now as the commander of Adonai’s army.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and he bowed down\lebnote{Or “he worshiped”} and said to him, “What is my lord commanding his servant?”}%
\verse{The commander of Adonai’s army said to Joshua, “Take off your sandals\lebnote{Hebrew “sandal”} from your feet,\lebnote{Hebrew “foot”} for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.}%

\begin{biblechapter}% Joshua 6
\verseWithHeading{The Battle of Jericho}{Now Jericho was shut up inside and out because of the presence of the Israelites;\lebnote{“sons/children of Israel”} no one was going out or coming in.}%
\verse{And Adonai said to Joshua, “Look, I am giving Jericho into your hand, its king and the soldiers of the army.}%
\verse{You will march around the city, all the warriors circling the city once; you will do so for six days.}%
\verse{And seven priests will bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day you will march around the city seven times, and the priests will blow on the trumpets.}%
\verse{And when they blow long on the horn of the ram, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people will shout with a great war cry, and the wall of the city will fall flat,\lebnote{Or “in its place”} and the people will charge, each one straight ahead.”\lebnote{“the people will go up, each before him”}}%
\verse{So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry the trumpets of the rams’ horns before the ark of Adonai.”}%
\verse{And he said\lebnote{Hebrew “they said”} to the people, “Go forward and march around the city, and let the armed men pass before the ark of Adonai.}%
\verse{And when Joshua spoke\lebnote{“And it happened the moment of the saying of Joshua”} to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the presence of Adonai went forward and they blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of Adonai followed behind them.}%
\verse{And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they were blowing the trumpets.}%
\verse{But Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You will not shout, and you will not let your voice be heard; a word will not go out from your mouth until the day I say to you ‘Shout!’ Then you will shout.”}%
\verse{And the ark of Adonai went around the city, circling once,\lebnote{“circling one occurrence”} and they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.}%
\verse{Then Joshua got up early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Adonai.}%
\verse{The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of the rams’ horns before the ark of Adonai went on continually, and they blew on the trumpets. And the armed men went before them, and the rear guard came after the ark of Adonai, while the trumpets blew continually.}%
\verse{And they marched around the city once on the second day, and they returned to the camp. They did this for six days.}%
\verse{Then on the seventh day they rose early at dawn, and they marched around the city in this manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times.}%
\verse{And at the seventh time the priests blew on the trumpets, and Joshua said to the people, “Shout! For Adonai has given you the city.}%
\verse{The city and all that is in it will be devoted to Adonai; only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in the house will live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.}%
\verse{As for you, keep away from the things\lebnote{Hebrew “thing”} devoted to destruction so that you do not take them and bring about your own destruction, making the camp of Israel an object for destruction, bringing trouble upon it.}%
\verse{But all of the silver and gold, and the items of bronze and iron, are holy to Adonai, and they must go to Adonai’s treasury.”}%
\verse{So the people shouted, and they\lebnote{That is, the priests} blew on the trumpets. And when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, they raised a great shout, and the wall fell flat. The people charged, each one straight ahead into the city,\lebnote{“The people went up, each before him”} and they captured it.}%
\verse{And they utterly destroyed by the edge of the sword\lebnote{“by the mouth of \textit{the} sword”} all who were in the city, both men and women, young and old, ox, sheep, and donkey.}%
\verse{Then Joshua said to the two men who spied on the land, “Go to the prostitute’s house and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her, just as you swore to her.”}%
\verse{So the young men who were spies went and brought Rahab and her father and mother, her brothers, and all who were with her. And they brought all her family out and set them outside the camp of Israel.}%
\verse{And they burned the city and all that was in it with fire; they put only the silver and gold, and the items of copper and iron, into the treasury of the house of Adonai.}%
\verse{But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute and her family\lebnote{“and the house of her father”} and all who were with her, and she has lived in the midst of Israel until this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.}%
\verse{And Joshua swore at that time, saying, “Cursed is anyone before Adonai who gets up and builds Jericho, this city. At the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.”}%
\verse{So Adonai was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.}%

\verseWithHeading{The Sin of Achan}{But the Israelites\lnBAH{} broke faith concerning the devoted things.\lebnote{Or “consecrated possession\textit{s}”} Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took from the devoted things;\lnBAI{} and Adonai’s anger was kindled\lebnote{“the nose of Adonai became hot”} against the Israelites.\lnBAH{}}%
\verse{Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven, east of Bethel, and he said to them, “Go up and spy out Ai.” And the men went up and spied out Ai.}%
\verse{And they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not let all the people go up and attack Ai; only two or three thousand men should go up because they\lebnote{That is, the people of Ai} are few. Do not make all the people weary up there.”}%
\verse{So about three thousand from the people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai.}%
\verse{The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, and they chased them from the gate up to Shebarim and killed them on the slope. And the hearts\lebnote{Hebrew “heart”} of the people melted and became like water.}%
\verse{And Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the ground on his face before the ark of Adonai until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads.\lebnote{Hebrew “head”}}%
\verse{And Joshua said, “Ah, my Lord! Why did you bring this people across the Jordan to give us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content and stayed beyond the Jordan.}%
\verse{Please, my Lord! What can I say after Israel has fled from its enemies?\lebnote{“Israel has turned its neck before its enemies”}}%
\verse{The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of this, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the land. What will you do, for your great name?”}%
\verse{And Adonai said to Joshua, “Stand up! Why\lebnote{“For what this”} have you fallen on your face?}%
\verse{Israel has sinned and transgressed my covenant\lebnote{“crossed my covenant”} that I commanded them. They have taken from the devoted things;\lebnote{Hebrew “thing” or “from the consecrated possession”} they have stolen and acted deceitfully, and they have put them among their belongings.}%
\verse{The Israelites\lnBAH{} were unable to stand before their enemies; they fled from their enemies\lebnote{“they turned \textit{their} neck before their enemies”} because they have become a thing devoted\lebnote{Or “consecrated”} for destruction. I will be with you no more\lebnote{“I will not do again to be with you”} unless you destroy the devoted things\lnBAI{} from among you.}%
\verse{Get up, sanctify the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow. Thus says Adonai the God of Israel: “There are devoted things\lnBAI{} in your midst, O Israel. You will be unable to stand before you enemies until you remove the devoted things\lnBAI{} from your midst.”}%
\verse{In the morning you will come forward, tribe by tribe,\lebnote{“according to your tribes”} and the tribe that Adonai will select by lot will come forward by clans, and the clan that Adonai selects by lot will come forward by families, and the family that Adonai selects by lot will come forward one by one.}%
\verse{The one caught with the devoted things\lnBAI{} will be burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he transgressed the covenant\lebnote{“he crossed the covenant”} of Adonai, and because he did a disgraceful thing in Israel.”’”}%
\verse{So\lebnote{Or “And”} Joshua rose early in the morning and brought forward Israel, tribe by tribe,\lebnote{“according to its tribes”} and the tribe of Judah was selected by lot.}%
\verse{And he brought forward the clans of Judah and selected the clan of the Zerahites\lnBAJ{} by lot. Then he brought forward the clan of the Zerahites,\lnBAJ{} one by one, and Zabdi was selected by lot.}%
\verse{He brought forward his family, one by one, and Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected by lot.}%
\verse{And Joshua said to Achan, “My son, please, give glory to Adonai the God of Israel, and give him a doxology in court.\lebnote{Some interpret “make a confession”} Tell me, please, what you have done; do not hide it from me.”}%
\verse{And Achan answered Joshua and said, “It is true. I have sinned against Adonai the God of Israel, and this is what I did:}%
\verse{I saw among the spoil a beautiful robe from Shinar,\lebnote{“Shinar” refers to Babylonia} two hundred shekels of silver, and one bar of gold that weighed fifty shekels; I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, and the silver is under it.”}%
\verse{Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and there they were, hidden in his tent, and the silver was under it.}%
\verse{And they took them from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites.\lnBAH{} And they spread them out before the presence of Adonai.}%
\verse{Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his cattle and donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and everything that was his, and they brought them to the valley of Achor.\lnBAK{}}%
\verse{And Joshua said, “Why did you bring us trouble? Adonai will bring you trouble on this day.” And all Israel stoned them\lebnote{Hebrew “him”} with stones;\lebnote{Hebrew “stone”} and they burned them with fire after they stoned them with stones.}%
\verse{Then they placed\lebnote{“they raised up”} on top of him a great pile of stones that remains to this day. And Adonai turned from his burning anger,\lebnote{“turned from his burning nose”} and thus the name of that place to this day is called the valley of Achor.\lnBAK{}}%
