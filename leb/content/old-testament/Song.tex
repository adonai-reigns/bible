\verseWithHeading{Title}{The Song of Songs,\lebnote{This construction conveys a superlative connotation, e.g., “The most exquisite song”} which is for\lebnote{Or “by Solomon” or “about/concerning Solomon”} Solomon.}%
\verseWithHeading{Maiden’s Soliloquy}{May\lebnote{In the maiden’s soliloquy, she thinks about her beloved in her thoughts (“May he kiss me!”), then poetically speaks to him as if he were in her presence (“for your love is better than wine”). To avoid confusion, the translation uses the second-person form throughout vv. 2–4} you kiss me\lebnote{“May he kiss me”} passionately with your lips,\lebnote{“with the kisses of his mouth”} for your love is better than wine.\lebnote{The shift from the third person “he … his” to the second person “you … your” in vv. 2–4 should not be interpreted as suggesting two different referents, that is, one male whom the maiden is addressing as “you,” and another to whom she refers as “he.” Rather, this shift is a poetic device (called “grammatical differentiation”) that is not uncommon in Hebrew poetry (e.g., Gen 49:4; Deut 32:15; Psa 23:2–5; Isa 1:29; 42:20; 54:1; Jer 22:24; Amos 4:1; Mic 7:19; Lam 3:1; Song 4:2; 6:6). This shift is characteristic of a soliloquy, a dramatic or literary form in which a character reveals her thoughts without addressing a listener who is actually present (e.g., 2 Sam 19:4). In this case, the maiden’s private thoughts about her beloved (v. 2a) shift to an imaginary address to her beloved (vv. 2b–4a)}}%
\verse{As fragrance, your perfumes\lebnote{“your oil lotions”} are delightful;\lebnote{“good”} your name is poured out perfume;\lebnote{“oil lotion”} therefore young women love you.}%
\verse{Draw me after you, let us run! May the king bring me into his chambers!\lebnote{Or “The king has brought me into his chambers”} Let us be joyful and let us rejoice in you; let us extol your love more than wine. Rightly do they love you!}%
\verseWithHeading{Maiden’s Self-Description}{I am black but beautiful,\lebnote{Or “black and beautiful”} O maidens of Jerusalem,\lebnote{“O daughters of Jerusalem”} like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.}%
\verse{Do not gaze at me because I am black,\lebnote{This is figurative for the maiden’s physical appearance; her skin was darkly tanned} because the sun has stared at me. The sons of my mother were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own “vineyard”\lebnote{“my vineyard that for me”} I did not keep.}%
\verseWithHeading{Dialogue between Shepherdess and Shepherd}{Tell me, you whom my heart\lebnote{“soul”} loves, where do you pasture your flock, where do your sheep lie down at the noon? For why should I be like\lebnote{“For to what will I be like”} one who is veiled\lebnote{The reading of the MT (“like one who is veiled”) is supported by the LXX. However, several ancient versions (Syriac Peshitta, Latin Vulgate, Symmachus) reflect an alternate Hebrew textual tradition in which two letters are transposed, resulting in the reading “like one who wanders about.” This makes good sense contextually, since the maiden does not know where her beloved would be at noon} beside the flocks of your companions?}%
\verse{If you do not know, O fairest among women, follow the tracks\lebnote{“in the tracks”} of the flock, and pasture your little lambs\lebnote{Or “your kids”} beside the tents of the shepherds.}%

\verseWithHeading{Dialogue between Maiden and Her Beloved}{I am a rose\lebnote{More likely “meadow saffron” or “crocus.” Hebrew scholars and botanists suggest the term refers to \textit{Ashodelos} (lily family), \textit{Narcissus tazetta} (narcissus or daffodil), or \textit{Colchicum autumnale} (meadow saffron or crocus) (e.g., Isa 35:1). The location of this flower in Sharon suggests a common wild flower rather than a rose. The maiden compares herself to a simple, common flower of the field} of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.}%
\verse{Like a lily among the thorns,\lebnote{Or “brambles”} so is my love among the maidens.}%

\verse{The blossoms appear\lebnote{“is seen”} in the land;\lebnote{“on the earth”} the time of singing\lebnote{Most likely, a subtle word play occurs here since there are two different words in Hebrew spelled the same way: “pruning” and “singing.” The former plays upon the first line and the latter upon the third line} has arrived;\lebnote{“the time of the song arrived”} the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.}%
\verse{The fig tree puts forth her figs, and the vines are in blossom; they give fragrance. Arise,\lebnote{“Arise, to you!”} my beloved! Come, my beauty!”\lebnote{“My beauty, come, you”}}%

\verse{Come out and look, O maidens of Zion,\lebnote{“O daughters of Zion”} at King Solomon,\lebnote{“the king, Solomon”} at the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, on the day of the joy of his heart!}%
