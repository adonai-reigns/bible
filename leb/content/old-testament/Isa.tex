\verse{An ox knows its owner and a donkey the manger of its master. Israel does not know; my people do not understand.}%
\verse{Ah, sinful nation, a people heavy with iniquity, offspring of evildoers, children who deal corruptly. They have forsaken Adonai; they have despised the holy one of Israel. They are estranged and gone backward.}%
\verse{Why do you want to be beaten again? You continue in rebellion. The whole of the head is sick, and the whole of the heart is faint.}%
\verse{From the sole of the foot and up to the head there is no health in it; bruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed, and they have not been bound up and not softened with the oil.}%
\verse{Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire; As for your land, aliens are devouring it in your presence, and it is desolate, like devastation by foreigners.}%
\verse{And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a shelter in a cucumber field, like a city that is besieged.\lebnote{Or “preserved”}}%
\verse{If Adonai of hosts had not left us survivors,\lebnote{Hebrew “survivor”} we would have been as few as Sodom, we would have become like Gomorrah.}%
\verse{Hear the word of Adonai, rulers of Sodom! Listen to the teaching of our God, people of Gomorrah!}%
\verse{What is the abundance of your sacrifices to me? says Adonai. I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fattened animals and I do not delight in the blood of bulls and ram-lambs and goats.}%
\verse{When you come to appear before me, who asked for this from your hand: you trampling my courts?}%
\verse{You must not continue\lebnote{“increase” or “add to”} to bring offerings\lebnote{Hebrew “offering”} of futility, incense — it is an abomination to me; new moon and Sabbath, the calling of a convocation — I cannot endure iniquity with solemn assembly.}%
\verse{Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates; they have become to me like a burden, I am not able to bear them.}%
\verse{And when you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers,\lebnote{Hebrew “prayer”} I will not be listening. Your hands are full of blood.}%
\verse{Wash! Make yourselves clean! Remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes! Cease to do evil!}%
\verse{Learn to do good! Seek justice! Rescue the oppressed! Defend the orphan! Plead for the widow!}%
\verse{“Come now, and let us argue,” says Adonai. “Even though your sins are like scarlet, they will be white like snow; even though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.}%
\verse{If you are willing and you are obedient, you shall eat the good of the land.}%
\verse{But if you refuse and you rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword. For the mouth of Adonai has spoken.”}%
\verseWithHeading{Purifying Jerusalem}{How has a faithful city become like a whore? Full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.}%
\verse{Your silver has become as dross; Your wine is diluted with waters.}%

\verse{Therefore, the declaration of the Lord Adonai of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: “Ah, I will be relieved of my enemies, and I will avenge myself on my foes.}%
\verse{And I will turn my hand against you; I will purify your dross like lye, and I will remove all of your tin.}%
\verse{And I will restore your judges, as at the first, and your counselors, as at the beginning. After this you will be called\lebnote{“it will be called for you”} the city of righteousness, faithful city.}%
\verse{Zion will be redeemed by justice, and those of her who repent, by righteousness.}%
\verse{But the destruction of rebels and sinners shall be together, and those who forsake Adonai will perish.}%
\verse{For you\lebnote{“they,” but a few manuscripts read “you,” which fits the context better} will be ashamed of the oaks in which you delighted, and you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.}%
\verse{For you shall be like an oak withering its leaves, and like a garden where there is no water for her.}%
\verse{And the strong man shall become like tinder, and his work like a spark. And both of them shall burn together, and there is not one to quench them.”}%
