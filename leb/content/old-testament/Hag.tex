\verse{And Haggai answered and said, “‘So it is with this people, and with this nation before me,’ declares\lnCTQ{} Adonai, ‘and so it is with every kind of work of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean.}%
\verse{But now, please consider\lnCTR{} from this day forward, before one stone was placed on another in the temple of Adonai,}%
