\verseWithHeading{The Preface to Luke’s Gospel}{Since many have attempted to compile an account concerning the events that have been fulfilled among us,}%
\verse{just as those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning passed on to us,}%
\verse{it seemed best to me also — because I\lebnote{“\textit{because}” is supplied as a component of the participle (“have followed”) which is understood as causal} have followed all things carefully from the beginning — to write them\lnDBD{} down in orderly sequence for you, most excellent Theophilus,}%
\verse{so that you may know the certainty concerning the things about which you were taught.}%
\verseWithHeading{The Prediction of John the Baptist’s Birth}{It happened that in the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest, Zechariah by name, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife\lebnote{“a wife to him”} from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.}%
\verse{And they were both righteous in the sight of God, living blamelessly in all the commandments and regulations of the Lord.}%
\verse{And they did not have\lebnote{“there was not to them”} a child, because Elizabeth was barren. And they were both advanced in years.\lebnote{“in their days”}}%
\verse{And it happened that while\lebnote{“\textit{while}” is supplied as a component of the temporal infinitive (“was serving as priest”)} he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,}%
\verse{according to the custom of the priesthood he was chosen by lot to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense.}%
\verse{And the whole crowd of the people were praying outside at the hour of the incense offering.}%
\verse{And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.}%
\verse{And Zechariah was terrified when he\lebnote{“\textit{when}” is supplied as a component of the participle (“saw”) which is understood as temporal} saw the angel,\lnDBE{} and fear fell upon him.}%
\verse{But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will call his name John.}%
\verse{And you will experience joy and exultation,\lebnote{“joy and exultation will be to you”} and many will rejoice at his birth.}%
\verse{For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he must never drink wine or beer, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit while he is\lebnote{the phrase “while he is,” including the verb, is understood in Greek and is supplied in the translation} still in his mother’s womb.}%
\verse{And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.}%
\verse{And he will go on before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to prepare for the Lord a people made ready.”}%
\verse{And Zechariah said to the angel, “By what will I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years!”\lebnote{“in her days”}}%
\verse{And the angel answered and\lnDBF{} said to him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to announce to you this good news.}%
\verse{And behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because\lebnote{“in return for which”} you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.”}%
\verse{And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and began to wonder\lebnote{Imperfect tense as ingressive (“began to wonder”)} when\lebnote{“\textit{when}” is supplied as a component of the temporal infinitive (“was delayed”)} he was delayed in the temple.}%
\verse{And when he\lebnote{“\textit{when}” is supplied as a component of the participle (“came out”) which is understood as temporal} came out he was not able to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them, and remained unable to speak.}%
\verse{And it happened that when the days of his service came to an end, he went away to his home.}%
\verse{Now after these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she kept herself in seclusion for five months, saying,}%
\verse{“Thus the Lord has done for me in the days in which he has concerned himself with me,\lnDBE{} to take away my disgrace among people.”}%
\verseWithHeading{The Prediction of Jesus’ Birth}{Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee named\lebnote{“to which the name”} Nazareth,}%

\verse{And he came to her and\lebnote{“\textit{and}” supplied because previous participle “came” translated as a finite verb} said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.”}%
\verse{But she was greatly perplexed at the statement, and was pondering what sort of greeting this might be.}%
\verse{And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.}%
\verse{And behold, you will conceive in the womb and will give birth to a son, and you will call his name Jesus.}%
\verse{This one will be great, and he will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.}%
\verse{And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever,\lebnote{“for the ages”} and of his kingdom there will be no end.}%
\verse{And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I have not had sexual relations with a man?”}%
\verse{And the angel answered and\lnDBF{} said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the one to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.}%
\verse{And behold, your relative Elizabeth — she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren.}%
\verse{For nothing will be impossible with God.”\lebnote{“every thing will not be impossible with God”}}%
\verse{So Mary said, “Behold, the Lord’s female slave! May it happen to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.}%
\verseWithHeading{Mary Visits Elizabeth}{Now in those days Mary set out and\lebnote{“\textit{and}” supplied because previous participle “set out” translated as a finite verb} traveled with haste into the hill country, to a town of Judah,}%
\verse{and entered into the house of Zechariah, and greeted Elizabeth.}%
\verse{And it happened that when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby in her womb leaped and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.}%
\verse{And she cried out with a loud shout and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!}%
\verse{And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?}%
\verse{For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy!}%

\verse{And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her home.}%
\verseWithHeading{The Birth of John the Baptist}{Now the time came for Elizabeth that she should give birth, and she gave birth to a son.}%
\verse{And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her,\lebnote{“the Lord had made great his mercy with her”} and they rejoiced with her.}%
\verse{And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were wanting to name him after\lebnote{“in the name of”} his father Zechariah.}%
\verse{And his mother answered and\lnDBF{} said, “No, but he will be named John.”}%
\verse{And they said to her, “There is no one of your relatives who is called by this name.”}%
\verse{So they made signs to his father asking what he wanted him to be named,}%
\verse{and he asked for a writing tablet and\lebnote{“\textit{and}” supplied because previous participle “asked for” translated as a finite verb} wrote, saying, “John is his name.” And they were all astonished.}%
\verse{And his mouth and his tongue were opened immediately, and he began to speak,\lebnote{Imperfect tense (“began to speak”)} praising God.}%
\verse{And fear came on all those who lived near them, and in all the hill country of Judea all these events were discussed.}%
\verse{And all those who heard kept these things\lnDBD{} in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be? For indeed the hand of the Lord was with him!”}%
\verseWithHeading{The Praise and Prophecy of Zechariah}{And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,}%
\verse{“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has visited to help and has redeemed\lebnote{“has done redemption for”} his people,}%
\verse{and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,}%
\verse{just as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times —}%
\verse{salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those who hate us,}%
\verse{to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant,}%
\verse{the oath that he swore to Abraham our father, to grant us}%
\verse{that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies, could serve him without fear}%

\verse{And so you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High, for you will go on before the Lord to prepare his ways,}%

\verse{because of the merciful compassion\lebnote{Or “heart”} of our God by which the dawn will visit to help us from on high,}%
\verse{to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace.”}%
\verse{And the child kept growing and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.}%
