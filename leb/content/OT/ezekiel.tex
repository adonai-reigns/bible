\verseWithHeading{Date of Vision of Living Creatures and Glory of the Throne of Adonai} And it was in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, and I was in the midst of the exiles by the \textit{Kebar River}. The heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
\verse On the fifth day of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of the king Jehoiachin—
\verse the word of Adonai \textit{came} clearly to Ezekiel the son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans at the \textit{Kebar River}, and the hand of Adonai was on him there.
\verse And I looked, and look! A storm wind was coming from the north, a great cloud, and fire flashing back and forth, and brightness around and \textit{within it}, and from its midst it was like the outward appearance of amber stone from the midst of the fire.
\verse And from its midst was the likeness of four living creatures, and this was their appearance: \textit{a human form},
\verse and \textit{each had four faces}, and \textit{each of them had four wings}.
\verse And their legs were straight legs, and the sole of their feet was like the sole of the foot of a calf, and they were sparkling like the outward appearance of polished bronze.
\verse And under their wings were \textit{human hands} on their four sides. And their faces and their wings for the four of them were as follows:
\verse \textit{their wings were touching one another}; \textit{each of them went straight forward}, \textit{without turning right or left}.
\verse The likeness of their faces was the face of a human in front, and the face of a lion on the right \textit{of each of them}, and the face of an ox on the left \textit{of each of them}, and the face of an eagle \textit{for each of them}.
\verse So were their faces; their wings were spread out \textit{upward}; each had two touching one another and two covering their bodies.
\verse And each \textit{went straight forward}; \textit{wherever the spirit went} they went, and \textit{they did not turn as they went}.
\verse As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. It was moving to and fro between the living creatures, and \textit{the fire was very bright} and lightning was going out from the fire.
\verse And the living creatures \textit{were speeding to and fro} like the appearance of lightning.
\verse And I saw the living creatures, and look! A wheel was on the earth beside \textit{each of the living creatures that had four faces}.
\verse The appearance of the wheels and their construction was like the appearance of beryl, and \textit{they all looked alike}, and their appearance and their construction was \textit{like a wheel within a wheel}.
\verse When they moved, they went toward their four sides; they did not \textit{veer at all as they went}.
\verse And their rims \textit{were high and awesome}, and \textit{all four of} their rims were full of eyes all around.
\verse And at the going of the living creatures, the wheels next to them also went, and \textit{when the creatures were lifted from the ground} the wheels also rose.
\verse \textit{Wherever} the spirit went they would go there, and the wheels rose, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
\verse At their going, they go, and at their standing, they stood, and at their being lifted up from on the earth, the wheels rose, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
\verse Now the likeness above the heads of the living creatures was an expanse like the outward appearance of \textit{awesome} \textit{ice} spread out above their heads \textit{upward}.
\verse And under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight \textit{one toward the other}; each had two wings covering them, and each had two wings covering their bodies.
\verse And I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the voice of Shaddai, and \textit{when they moved} there was a sound of tumult like the sound of an army; \textit{when they stood still} they lowered their wings.
\verse And there was a sound from above the expanse that was above their heads, \textit{and when they stood} they lowered their wings.
\verse And from above the expanse that was above their heads there was the likeness of a throne, \textit{looking like a sapphire}, and above the likeness of the throne was a likeness similar to the appearance of a human on it, but \textit{above it}.
\verse And I saw something like the outward appearance of amber, something like the appearance of fire, with a covering around it, from the likeness of his loins and \textit{upward}. And from the likeness of his loins and \textit{downward} I saw something like the appearance of fire, and \textit{it was radiant all around}.
\verse Like the appearance of a bow that is in the cloud on \textit{a rainy day}, such was the radiance around it; thus was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Adonai. And I saw, and I fell on my face, and I heard a voice speaking.

\verseWithHeading{The Call of Ezekiel to Speak God’s Words} And he said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, so that I can speak with you.”
\verse And the Spirit came into me as he was speaking to me, and it set me on my feet, and I heard the one speaking to me.
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the \textit{Israelites}, to nations who are rebelling, who rebelled against me, they and their ancestors, they transgressed against me \textit{until this very day}.
\verse And the children are \textit{impudent} and \textit{stubborn}, and so I am sending you to them, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai!’
\verse And they, whether they listen or whether they fail to listen, for they are a rebellious house, they will know that a prophet was in their midst.
\verse And you, son of man, you must not be afraid of them, and you must not be afraid of their words, because briers and thorns are with you, and you are sitting among scorpions. You must not be afraid of their words, and you must not be dismayed because of their \textit{looks}, for they are a rebellious house.
\verse And you must speak my words to them whether they listen or whether they fail to listen, for they are rebellious.
\verse And you, son of man, hear what I am speaking to you: you must not be rebellious like the house of rebellion. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving to you.”
\verse And I looked, and look! There was a hand stretched out to me, and look! In it was \textit{a scroll with writing}.
\verse And he rolled it out \textit{before me}, and it was written on the front and back, and there were written on it laments and mourning and wailing.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Ezekiel 3
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, what you find, eat! Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.”
\verse And I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat,
\verse and he said to me, “Son of man, you must give your stomach this to eat, and you must fill your belly with this scroll that I am giving to you.” And I ate, and it became \textit{like sweet honey} in my mouth.
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, come! Go to the house of Israel, and you must speak to them with my words.
\verse For you are sent to the house of Israel, not to a people \textit{of obscure speech} and \textit{of a difficult language},
\verse and not to many nations \textit{of obscure speech} and \textit{a difficult language} \textit{whose words} you do not understand, for if I had sent you to them they would have listened to you.
\verse And the house of Israel, they are not willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me, for all of the house of Israel is hard of forehead, and they are hard of heart.
\verse But look, I have made your face hard \textit{against} their faces and your forehead hard \textit{against} their forehead.
\verse Like a diamond \textit{harder than flint} I have made your forehead; you must not fear them, and you must not be dismayed \textit{on account of them}, for they \textit{are a rebellious house}.
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, all of my words that I shall speak to you, receive into your heart and hear with your ears.
\verse And come, go to the exiles, to the children of your people, and you must speak to them, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai!’ whether they listen or whether they fail to listen.”
\verse And the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake when the glory of Adonai rose from its place.
\verse And it was the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching lightly \textit{one against the other}, and the sound of the wheels beside them and the sound of a great earthquake.
\verse And the Spirit lifted me and took me, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Adonai was strong on me.
\verse And I went to the exiles at Tel Abib, who were dwelling near the \textit{Kebar River}, and I sat where they were dwelling. I sat there seven days in the midst of them, stunned.
\verse And then it happened at the end of seven days, \textit{the word of Adonai came} to me, saying,
\verse “Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear a word from my mouth, then you must warn them from me.
\verse \textit{When I say} to the wicked, ‘Surely you will die,’ and you do not warn him and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way \textit{so that he may live}, that wicked person will die because of his guilt, and from your hand I will seek his blood.
\verse And you, if you do warn the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness and from his wicked way, on account of his guilt he will die, and you yourself will have saved your life.
\verse And \textit{when the righteous turns from his righteousness} and does injustice, and I place a stumbling block \textit{before him}, he will die, for you did not warn him. Because of his sin he will die, and his righteousness that he did will not be remembered, and his blood I shall seek from your hand.
\verse And if you warn him, the righteous, not to sin, and the righteous does not sin, surely he will live, for he heeded a warning. And you will have saved your life.”
\verse And the hand of Adonai was on me there, and he said to me, “Rise up, go out to the valley, and there I will speak with you.”
\verse And I rose up, and I went to the valley, and, look, there the glory of Adonai was standing, like the glory that I saw near the \textit{Kebar River}, and I fell on my face.
\verse And the Spirit came into me, and it made me stand on my feet, and he spoke with me and said to me, “Come, shut yourself \textit{inside your house},
\verse and you, son of man, look, they will place cords on you, and they will tie you up with them. Then you will not go out into the midst of them.
\verse And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, and you will be silenced, and you will not be a reproving man for them, for they \textit{are a rebellious house}.
\verse And when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai: “The one hearing him, let him hear, and the one failing to hear, let him fail,” ’ for they \textit{are a rebellious house}.

\verseWithHeading{Siege of Jerusalem Illustrated on a Brick} “Now, son of man, take for yourself a brick, and you must put it \textit{before you}, and you must portray on it a city, Jerusalem.
\verse And you must build against it siege works, and you must build against it a bulwark, and you must heap against it a siege ramp, and you must set up against it camps and put against it a battering ram all around.
\verse And take for yourself a plate of iron, and you must place it as a wall of iron between you and the city, and you must set your face against it, and it must be \textit{under siege}, and you must lay the siege against it; it is a sign for the house of Israel.
\verse And you, lie down on your left side, and you must put the guilt of the house of Israel on it. You will carry their guilt the number of days that you will lie on it.
\verse And I will give to you the years of their guilt according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days, and you must bear the guilt of the house of Israel.
\verse When you have completed these, then you must lie a second time on your right side; and you must bear the guilt of the house of Judah forty days, a day for each year, a day for each year I give it to you.
\verse And toward the siege of Jerusalem you must set your face and your bared arm; then you must prophesy against it.
\verse Now look! I will put on you cords, and you may not turn yourself from one side to your other side until you complete the days of your siege.
\verseWithHeading{Ezekiel’s Strange Defiled Meal} “And you, take for yourself wheat and barley and beans and lentils and millet and spelt, and you must put them in one vessel, and you must make them for yourself into a food during the number of days that you are lying on your side; three hundred and ninety days you shall eat it.
\verse And your food that you will eat will be according to weight; twenty shekels for each day \textit{at fixed times} you shall eat it.
\verse And \textit{an amount of water} you shall drink, a sixth of a hin; \textit{at fixed times} you shall drink it.
\verse And as a bread-cake of barley you shall eat it, and \textit{with human excrement} you shall bake it before their eyes.”
\verse And Adonai said, “Thus shall the \textit{Israelites} eat their unclean food among the nations \textit{where I will scatter them}.”
\verse And I said, “Ah, Lord Adonai! Look! I have not been defiling myself, and a dead body and mangled carcass I have not eaten from my childhood until now, and \textit{unclean meat} has not come into my mouth!”
\verse And he said to me, “See I will give you \textit{cattle manure} in the place of the feces of a human, and you may prepare your food on it.”
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, look, I am going to break the \textit{supply} of bread in Jerusalem, and they will eat bread by weight, \textit{anxiously}, and \textit{rationed water}, and they will drink with horror,
\verse so that they will lack food and water, and they will be appalled \textit{with one another}, and they will waste away because of their guilt.

\verse “And you, son of man, take for yourself a sword, sharp as \textit{a barber’s razor}. Take it for yourself, and you must cause it to pass over your head and over your beard, and you must take for yourself a set of scales for weighing, and you must divide them.
\verse A third you must burn with fire in the midst of the city at \textit{the completion} of the days of the siege, and you must take a third, and you must strike it with the sword around it, and a third you must scatter to the wind, and I will draw a sword behind them.
\verse And you must take from these a few in number, and you must tuck them in your hem.
\verse And from them again you shall take some, and you must throw them in the middle of the fire, and you must burn them with fire; from it a fire will go out to all of the house of Israel.
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai: This is Jerusalem in the midst of the nations where I have put her, and countries are around her.
\verse But she has rebelled against my regulations to the point of wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are around her; for they rejected my regulations, and as for my statutes, they did not walk in them.
\verse Therefore, thus says the Lord Adonai: Because of your commotion more than the nations that are around you—you did not walk in my statutes, and you did not do my regulations, and according to the regulations of the nations that are around you, you did not do.
\verse Therefore thus says the Lord Adonai: Look! I, \textit{even I}, am against you, and I will execute judgment in the midst of you before the eyes of the nations,
\verse and I will do with you that which I have not done, and which I will not do again, because of all of your detestable things.
\verse Therefore parents will eat children in the midst of you, and children will eat their parents, and I will execute judgment in you, and I will scatter your entire remnant to every wind.
\verse Therefore \textit{as surely as I live}, \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai, \textit{Surely} because you have defiled my sanctuary with all of your vile idols and with all of your detestable things, \textit{now indeed I} will reduce, and my eye will not take pity, and surely I will show no compassion.
\verse A third of you will die because of the plague, and because of the famine they will perish in the midst of you, and a third will fall through the sword around you, and a third I will scatter to every direction of the wind, and I will draw the sword behind them.
\verse And my anger will come to an end, and I will place my rage on them, and I will relent, and they will know that I, Adonai, have spoken in my passion \textit{when I fully vent my rage against them}.
\verse And I will make you into a desolate place and into a disgrace among the nations that surround you before the eyes of \textit{every one who passes by}.
\verse And it will be an object of taunting and an object of mockery, a warning and a horror to the nations that are around you whenever I execute judgments against you in anger and in wrath and in furious punishments! I, Adonai, have spoken!
\verse When I send my arrows of deadly famine against them, which will be as destruction that I will send in order to destroy you, I will increase famine against you, and I will break \textit{the supply of food} for you.
\verse And I will send against you famine and fierce animals, and they will make you childless; and plague and blood will pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I, Adonai, I have spoken!”

\verseWithHeading{Idolatrous Worship and Idolatrous Objects Denounced} And the word of Adonai \textit{came} to me, saying,

\verse But I will spare some, \textit{so there will be} for you fugitives from the sword among the nations \textit{when you are scattered} in the countries.
\verse And your fugitives will remember me among the nations to which they were taken captive, that I was shattered by \textit{their adulterous heart} which departed from me, and by \textit{their adulterous eyes} which went after their idols, and they will feel loathing \textit{for themselves}, for the evil that they did, for all of their detestable things.
\verse And they will know that I am Adonai; not \textit{in vain} I spoke to bring to them this evil.” ’
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai: ‘Clap your hand and stamp with your foot, and say, “Alas, for all of the detestable things of the evil of the house of Israel, \textit{because of which} they will fall with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague.
\verse The one who is far away will die by the plague, and the one who is near will fall by the sword, and the one who is being left behind and being spared will die by the famine, and I will complete my rage on them.
\verse And you will know that I am Adonai \textit{when their slain ones are in the midst of their idols} around their altars at every high hill, on the tops of all the mountains and under every green tree and under every leafy oak—the place at which they gave a pleasing scent for all of their idols.
\verse And I will stretch out my hand against them, and I will make the land a desolation and a wasteland from the desert to Riblah in all of their dwellings, and they will know that I am Adonai.” ’ ”

\verse Violence has grown to become a staff of wickedness; \textit{none} from them will remain, and \textit{none} from their abundance nor from their wealth; and prominence will not be among them.

\verse For the seller will not return to the merchandise \textit{while they are still alive}, for the vision is about all of its multitude; it will not change, and a man because of his guilt will not be able to hold onto his life.
\verse They shall blow on the trumpet and prepare \textit{everything}, but there is no one going to the battle, for my anger is on all of their multitude.
\verse The sword \textit{is outside}, and the plague and the famine \textit{are inside}; the one who is in the field will die by the sword, and the one who is in the city, famine and plague will devour him.
\verse And if their survivors will escape, they will be on the mountains, like the doves of the valley, all of them groaning, each because of his guilt.
\verse All of the hands will hang limp, and all of \textit{the knees will be wet with urine}.
\verse And they will wear sackcloth, and horror will cover them, and on all of the faces will be shame, and baldness on all of their heads.
\verse Their silver they will discard on the streets, and filth will be their gold; their silver and their gold will not be able to rescue them on the day of the wrath of Adonai. They will not satisfy their \textit{hunger} and their stomachs they will not fill, for their guilt will be their stumbling block.

\verse And I will turn my face from them, and they will defile my treasured place, and violent ones will enter and defile it.
\verse Make a chain for the land; it is full of \textit{bloody crimes} and the city is full of violence.
\verse And I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will take possession of their houses, and I will put to an end the pride of the mighty ones, and their sanctuaries will be defiled.
\verse Anguish comes, and they will seek peace, and there will be none.
\verse Calamity upon calamity will come, and rumor will be upon rumor. And they will seek a vision from a prophet, but instruction will perish from the priest and counsel from the elders.
\verse The king will mourn, and the prince will be dressed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. According to their way I will do to them, and according to their judgments I will judge them, and they will know that I am Adonai.’ ”

\verse Now the cherubim were standing on the south of the temple \textit{when the man went}, and the cloud filled the inner courtyard.
\verse And the glory of Adonai rose up from on the cherub toward the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the courtyard was filled with the brightness of the glory of Adonai.
\verse And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard \textit{as far as} the outer courtyard; it was like the voice of God Shaddai \textit{when he speaks}.
\verse And then at his command to the man clothed in linen, \textit{saying}, “Take fire from among the wheel area from among the cherubim,” he went and stood beside the wheel.
\verse Then the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim toward the fire that was among the cherubim, and he lifted up and gave it into the hollow of the hand of the man clothed with linen, and he took it, and he went out.
\verse And there appeared for the cherubim the form of \textit{a human hand} under their wings.
\verse And I saw, and look, four wheels beside the cherubim, \textit{one wheel beside each cherub}, and the appearance of the wheels was like the outward appearance of \textit{turquoise stone}.
\verse Their appearance \textit{was the same for each of the four of them}, as if the wheel was in the midst of a wheel.
\verse \textit{When they went} to the four of their directions that they went, they did not change direction \textit{when they went}, for the place to which the head turned, they went behind him; they did not change direction at their going.
\verse And \textit{their whole body}, and their rims, and their spokes, and their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all around—\textit{the wheels for the four of them}.
\verse Concerning the wheels, he was calling them “the wheelwork” \textit{in my hearing}.
\verse And \textit{each one had four faces}; the face of the one was the face of a cherub, and the face of the second was the face of a human, and the face of the third was the face of a lion, and the fourth was the face of an eagle.
\verse And the cherubim rose; that is, the living creatures that I saw at the \textit{Kebar River}.
\verse And \textit{when the cherubim went}, the wheels beside them went; and \textit{when the cherubim lifted their wings to rise up from the earth}, the wheels also did not turn aside from beside them.
\verse \textit{When they stood}, they stood, and at their rising, they rose with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
\verse And the glory of Adonai went out from the threshold of the temple, and it stood above the cherubim.
\verse And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and they rose from the earth before my eyes. At their going out, the wheels were beside them. And he stood at the doorway of the eastern gate of the temple of Adonai, and the glory of the God of Israel \textit{was over them}.
\verse This was the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel at the \textit{Kebar River}, and I knew that they were cherubim.
\verse \textit{Each one had four faces}, and there were four wings for each, and the likeness of \textit{human hands} was under their wings.
\verse And the likeness of their faces, they were the faces that I saw at the \textit{Kebar River}; thus was their appearance, and they each went \textit{straight ahead}.

\verseWithHeading{Judgment On Evil Rulers} And the Spirit lifted me up, and it brought me to the eastern gate, the one facing east, of the temple of Adonai. And look, there were twenty-five men in the doorway of the gate, and I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azzur in the midst of them, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the commanders of the people.
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, these are the men \textit{who devise mischief}, and who are offering bad counsel in this city,
\verse who are saying, “The building of houses is not near; the city is the pot, and we are the flesh.
\verse Therefore prophesy against them! Prophesy, son of man!”
\verse And the Spirit of Adonai fell on me, and he said to me, “Say, ‘thus says Adonai: “This is what you think, house of Israel, and I myself know them, the thoughts of your spirit.
\verse You made your slain ones numerous in this city, and you have filled its streets with slain ones.” ’
\verse Therefore thus says the Lord Adonai: “Your slain ones whom you put in its midst, they are the flesh, and it is the pot, and I will bring you out from its midst.
\verse The sword you have feared, and the sword I will bring against you!” \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.
\verse “And I will bring you out from its midst, and I will give you into the hand of strangers, and I will execute judgments against you.
\verse By the sword you will fall at the border of Israel; I will judge you, and you will know that I am Adonai.
\verse It will not be as a pot to you, and so you would be in the midst of it as flesh, for at the border of Israel I will judge you.
\verse And you will know that I am Adonai, whose rules you did not follow, and whose regulations you did not do, but according to the regulations of the nations that are around you, you acted.” ’
\verse And it happened that \textit{as I was prophesying}, Pelatiahu the son of Benaiahu died! And I fell on my face, and I cried with a loud voice, and I said, “Ah, Lord Adonai, you are making a complete destruction of the remnant of Israel!”
\verse And the word of Adonai \textit{came} to me, \textit{saying},
\verse “Son of man, your brothers, your brothers, the men of your redemption, and all of the house of Israel, all of it, \textit{who said concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem}, ‘They are far from Adonai, therefore to us this land was given as a possession.’
\verse Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai: “Though I have removed them far away among the nations and though I have scattered them among the countries, yet I was a sanctuary to them for a little while in the countries \textit{to which they have gone}.’ ”
\verse Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai: “And I will assemble you from the peoples, and I will gather you from the countries to which you were scattered among them, and I will give the land of Israel to you.
\verse And when they come there, then they will remove all of its vile idols and all of its detestable things from it.
\verse And I will give to them one heart, and a new spirit I will give in their inner parts. And I will remove their heart of stone from their body, and I will give to them a heart of flesh,
\verse so that they may walk in my statutes, and they will keep my regulations, and they will do them, and they will be to me a people, and I myself will be to them as God.
\verse But to the heart of their abominations and the detestable things their heart is going. I will bring their way on their head,” \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.’ ”
\verse Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and their wheels were beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel \textit{was over them}.
\verse And the glory of Adonai went up from the midst of the city, and it stood still on the mountain that is to the east of the city.
\verse And the Spirit lifted me up, and it brought me to Chaldea, to the exiles, in the vision by the spirit of God; and the vision that I had seen \textit{left me}.
\verse And I spoke to the exiles all of the words of Adonai that he had shown me.

\verse Before their eyes, on your shoulder, you must lift up the baggage in the dusk, and your face you must cover, so that you may not see the land, for I make you as a sign to the house of Israel.”
\verse And I did \textit{just as} I was commanded; my baggage, like the baggage of an exile, I brought out by day, and in the evening I dug through for myself into the wall with my hand in the dusk; I brought the baggage on my shoulder; I carried it before their eyes.

\verse And they were proud, and they did a detestable thing \textit{before me}, and I removed them \textit{because} I saw it.
\verse And Samaria did not sin \textit{according to even half of your sins}, and you caused your detestable things to increase more than they, and you made your sister righteous in comparison with all of your detestable things that you did.
\verse Also, you bear your disgrace, by which you furnished justification to your sisters through your sins by which you acted more abominably than they; they were more righteous than you, and also, you be ashamed and bear your disgrace through your making your sister righteous.
\verse And I will restore their fortune, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and even the fortunes of your captivity in the midst of them,
\verse in order that you may bear your disgrace and you may be put to shame because of all that you did at your consoling them.
\verse And as for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, they will return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters, they will return to their former state, and you and your daughters will return to your former state.
\verse And was not Sodom, your sister, a byword in your mouth in the day of your pride
\verse \textit{before} your evil was uncovered? It was like the time of the scorn of the daughters of Aram and all those around her, and of the daughters of the Philistines, those all around who are despising you.
\verse Your wickedness and your detestable things, you, you must bear them,’ \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse ‘For thus says the Lord Adonai: And I will do it to you \textit{according to what you have done}, who despised the oath to break covenant.
\verse And I, I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish with you \textit{an everlasting covenant}.
\verse And you will remember your ways, and you will be ashamed when you take your sisters, \textit{both the older and the younger}, and I give them to you as daughters, but not on account of your covenant.
\verse And I, I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am Adonai,

\verseWithHeading{Parable of Two Eagles and a Vine} And the word of Adonai \textit{came} to me, \textit{saying},
\verse “Son of man, tell a riddle and quote a proverb to the house of Israel,
\verse and you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai: “\textit{The great eagle with great wings and long feathers} and \textit{full of variegated plumage} came to Lebanon and he took the treetop of the cedar.
\verse He plucked the top of its new plant shoot, and he brought it to the land of Canaan and put it in a city of merchants,
\verse and he took from the seed of the land and placed it in \textit{fertile soil} on many waters; like a willow he planted it.
\verse And it sprouted, and \textit{it became a vine spreading out}, low of height, turning its branches to him, and its roots were under it, and \textit{it became a vine}, and it made branches, and it sent out foliage.
\verse “ ‘ “And there was another great eagle, great of wings and with abundant plumage, and look! This vine stretched out its roots toward him and extended its branches to him to water it from the garden bed \textit{where it was planted}.
\verse It was planted in a good field by many waters to produce branches and to bear fruit to become \textit{a beautiful vine}.” ’
\verse Say, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai: “Will it prosper? Will he not tear out its roots, and will he not make its fruit scaly, and it will wither, and all of the freshness of its vegetation will dry up? And to lift it from its roots \textit{will not require great strength or many people}.
\verse And look! Though it is planted, will it prosper? \textit{When the east wind strikes it}, will it not dry up completely? On the garden bed of its vegetation it will dry up!” ’ ”

\verse “Say now to the rebellious house of Israel, ‘Do you not know what these are?’ Say, ‘Look! The king of Babylon will come to Jerusalem, and he will take its king and its officials, and he will bring them to himself, to Babylon.
\verse And he took from the seed of the kingship, and he made with him a covenant, and \textit{he brought him under oath}, and he took the rulers of the land,
\verse so that they would be a humble kingdom and not lift itself up to keep his covenant \textit{in order for it to stand}.
\verse But he rebelled against him by sending his messengers to Egypt to give to him horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Will he escape doing these things, and can he break the covenant and escape?
\verse \textit{As I live},’ \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai, ‘\textit{surely} in the place of the king \textit{who made} him king, who despised his oath and who broke his covenant with him—in the midst of Babylon he will die.
\verse And not with a great army and with a great crowd will Pharaoh work with him in the war, at the pouring out of a siege ramp and the building of siege works to destroy many lives.
\verse And he despised the oath to break covenant. And, look, he gave his hand in pledge, and yet he did all of these things. He will not escape.’
\verse Therefore thus says the Lord Adonai: ‘\textit{As I live}, \textit{surely} my oath that he despised and my covenant that he broke I will return upon his head.
\verse And I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my hunting net, and I will bring him to Babylon, and I will enter into judgment with him there about his infidelity that he displayed against me.
\verse And all of his choice troops, among all of his troops, they will fall by the sword, and those who are remaining, they will be scattered to all the directions of the wind, and you will know that I, Adonai, I have spoken.’
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai: ‘And I will take, even I, from the treetop of the high cedar, and I will plant it, from the head of its new plant shoot I will pluck a tender one, and I will plant it, even I, on a high and lofty mountain.
\verse On the height of the mountain of Israel I will plant it, and it will carry branches, and it will bear fruit, and \textit{it will become a noble cedar}, and all of the birds of all wings will dwell under it in the shade of its branches.
\verse And all of the trees of the field will know that I, Adonai, I will bring low a high tree, and I will exalt a low, fresh tree, and I will make a dry tree flourish. I, Adonai, I have spoken, and I will do it.’ ”

\verse The conspiracy of its prophets in the midst of her is like a roaring lion that is tearing prey. They devour people, and they take wealth and treasure; they make its widows numerous in the midst of her.
\verse Its priests treat my law violently, and they profane my holy objects; they do not distinguish between a holy object and what is unholy, or between the clean and the unclean. They do not teach the difference, and they hide their eyes from my Sabbaths, and so I am profaned in the midst of them.
\verse Its officials are like wolves tearing prey in its midst, to pour out blood, to destroy people, to make dishonest gain.
\verse And for them its prophets plaster whitewash; they are seeing falseness and are practicing divination for them by lying, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai,’ and Adonai has not spoken.
\verse They severely oppress the people of the land, and \textit{they committed robbery}, and they mistreated the needy and the poor, and they oppressed the alien \textit{without} justice.
\verse And so I sought for them somebody, one repairing the wall and standing in the breach \textit{before me} on behalf of the land not to destroy it, but I did not find anyone,
\verse and so I poured out my indignation on them. With the fire of my wrath I destroyed them; I returned their way upon their head,” \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.

\verseWithHeading{Oholah and Oholibah as Symbols of God’s Corrupt People} And the word of Adonai \textit{came} to me, \textit{saying},
\verse “Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother,
\verse and they prostituted themselves in Egypt in their childhood; they were prostituting themselves there, and their breasts were fondled, and there they caressed the bosoms of their virginity.
\verse Now as for their names, the older was Oholah, and Oholibah was her sister. And \textit{they became mine}, and they bore sons and daughters, and their names are Samaria for Oholah, and Jerusalem for Oholibah.
\verse And Oholah prostituted herself \textit{while she was still mine}, and she lusted for her lovers, for Assyria who was nearby,
\verse clothed in blue cloth, governors and prefects, \textit{handsome young men} and all of them horsemen, \textit{experts on horseback}.
\verse And she bestowed her fornication on them, on the choice ones of the \textit{Assyrians}, all of them, and with every one after which she lusted; with all of their idols she defiled herself.
\verse And her whorings from the time of Egypt she did not abandon, for they slept with her in her childhood, and they caressed the bosoms of her virginity, and they poured out their fornication on her.
\verse Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the \textit{Assyrians} \textit{after whom she lusted}.
\verse They uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, and they killed her with the sword. And she became a name for the women, and they executed judgments against her.
\verse “And though Oholibah her sister saw, yet in her lust \textit{she behaved more corruptly than her}, and her whoring was more than the prostitution of her sister.
\verse She lusted after the \textit{Assyrians}, governors and prefects, warriors clothed in perfection, \textit{expert horsemen}, all of them \textit{handsome young men}.
\verse And I saw that she was defiled; \textit{they had both taken the same path}!
\verse And she increased her whorings, and she saw men carved on the wall, images of Chaldeans carved in red,
\verse belted with a belt at their waist with turbans on their heads, all of them giving the appearance of adjutants, the image of the \textit{Babylonians}; Chaldea was the land of their birth.
\verse And she lusted for them \textit{when her eyes saw them}, and she sent messengers to them at Chaldea.
\verse And so the \textit{Babylonians} came to her for the bed of lovemaking; and they defiled her with their fornication, and she was defiled by them, and she turned from them.
\verse And she revealed her whorings, and she revealed her nakedness, and so I turned from her \textit{just as} I turned from her sister.
\verse Yet she increased her whorings, \textit{recalling} the days of her childhood when she was prostituted in the land of Egypt.
\verse And she lusted after her male lovers whose genitalia were the genitalia of male donkeys and their seminal emission was the seminal emission of horses.
\verse And you longed after the obscene conduct of your youth when your bosom was caressed by Egypt, fondling your young breasts.
\verse “Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord Adonai: ‘Look! I am stirring up your lovers against you concerning whom you turned away, and I will bring them against you from all around:
\verse the \textit{Babylonians} and all of the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, all of the \textit{Assyrians} along with them, \textit{handsome young men}, governors and prefects, all of them adjutants \textit{and excellent horsemen}.
\verse And they will come against you with an army chariot and wagon and with a crowd of peoples; they will set themselves against you from all around with large shield and small shield and helmet. And I will give \textit{before them} judgment, and they will judge you with their judgments.
\verse And I will direct my zeal against you, and they will deal with you in anger; your nose and your ears they will remove, and \textit{those who are left}, they will fall by the sword, and they will take your sons and your daughters, and \textit{your remnant} will be consumed by fire.
\verse And they will strip you of your clothes, and they will take \textit{your splendid jewelry}.
\verse And I will put an end to your obscene conduct coming from you and your fornication from the land of Egypt, and you will not lift your eyes to them; and you will not remember Egypt again.’
\verse For thus says the Lord Adonai: ‘Look! I am giving you into the hand of those you hated, into the hand of those from whom you turned away.
\verse And they will deal with you in hatred, and they will take all of your acquisitions, and they will leave you naked and in bareness; and the nakedness of your fornication and your obscene conduct and your whorings will be exposed.
\verse These things are accomplished against you since you prostituted yourself after the nations, and on account of that, you defiled yourself by their idols.
\verse You went in the same way of your sister, and I will give her cup into your hand.” ’
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai: “You will drink the deep and wide cup of your sister; you will be as laughter and as scorn; \textit{the cup holds so much}!
\verse You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, for a cup of horror and desolation is the cup of your sister, Samaria.
\verse And you will drink it, and you will drain it, and its potsherds you will gnaw, and you will tear out your breasts, for \textit{I myself} spoke,” \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.
\verse Therefore thus says the Lord Adonai: “Because you have forgotten me, and you threw me behind your back, now in turn you bear your obscene conduct and your whorings.”
\verse And Adonai said to me, “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah and declare their abominable deeds to them?
\verse For they committed adultery, and blood is on their hands, and they committed adultery with their idols, and even their children that they had borne for me—they sacrificed them as food!
\verse Also they did this to me: they defiled my sanctuary on that day, and they profaned my Sabbaths,
\verse and when they slaughtered their children for their idols, they came to my sanctuary on that day to profane it. And look, \textit{this is what they did in my house}!
\verse \textit{What is worse}, they sent for men \textit{who come} from a distant place, to whom a messenger was sent to them, and look! They came! Men for whom you bathed and painted your eyes, and you adorned yourself with an ornament.
\verse And you sat on a magnificent couch and a table prepared \textit{before her}, and my incense and my olive oil you put on her.
\verse And a sound of a carefree crowd was with it, and in addition to these men, \textit{a crowd of drunken men was brought in} from the desert, and they put bracelets on their arms and a crown of splendor on their heads.
\verse And I said to the one worn out with adulteries, ‘Now they will prostitute her concerning her fornication, even her.’
\verse And so they went to her like going to a female prostitute; and thus they went to Oholah and to Oholibah, the women of obscene conduct.
\verse But righteous men, they will judge them with the judgment of committing adultery, and with the judgment of shedding blood; for they were committing adultery, and blood was on their hands.”
\verse For thus says the Lord Adonai: “Bring up against them an assembly, and make them as a thing of horror and as plunder.
\verse And an assembly must stone them with stones, and they must cut them down. With their swords they shall kill their sons and their daughters, and with fire they shall burn their houses.
\verse And \textit{I will cause obscene conduct to cease from the land}, and all of the women will be warned, and they will not do according to your wickedness.

\verse And so I will put hooks in your jawbones, 
and I will make the fish of your Nile streams stick to your scales,

\verse And the land of Egypt will become a desolation and ruins, and they will know that I am Adonai because he said, ‘The Nile is \textit{mine}! And I, I made it!’
\verse Therefore look! I am against you and against your Nile streams, and I will make the land of Egypt into ruins, a pile of rubble, a desolation from Migdol to Syene and up to the boundary of Cush.
\verse A foot of a human will not pass over it, and a foot of an animal will not pass over it, and so it will not be inhabited for forty years.
\verse And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated countries, and its cities to be in the midst of ruined cities. They will be a desolation for forty years, and I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and I will disperse them among the countries.”
\verse For thus says the Lord Adonai: “At the end of forty years I will gather Egypt from the peoples among whom they were scattered.
\verse And I will restore the fortunes of Egypt, and I will bring them back to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and they will be a lowly kingdom there.
\verse Of all the kingdoms it will be the most lowly, and it will not exalt itself again over the nations, and I will make them small so as not to rule over the nations.
\verse And it will not be again for the house of Israel an object of trust, bringing to remembrance their guilt \textit{when they turned back to them}, and they will know that I am the Lord Adonai.”

\verse “Son of man, say to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to his crowd,
\verse ‘To whom are you like in your greatness?
\verse Look! Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon, 
with beautiful branches and a forest giving shade, 
and \textit{very high}, 
and its treetop was between the clouds.
\verse Waters made it great, 
the deep made it grow high; 
its rivers were going all around \textit{its planting area}, 
and its channels it sent out 
to all of the trees of the field.
\verse Therefore it became tall, 
with its height more than all of the trees of the field, 
and its branches became numerous, 
and its branches became long 
\textit{from its sending its shoots from abundant water}.
\verse In its branches all the birds of the heaven made their nest, 
and under its branches all the animals of the field gave birth, 
and in its shadow all the many nations lived.
\verse And it was beautiful in its greatness, 
in the length of its branches, 
for its root was toward much water.
\verse Cedars in the garden of God 
could not be equal to it; 
fir trees could not resemble its branches, 
and plane trees were not even like its branches; 
any tree even in the garden of God 
could not resemble it in its beauty.
\verse Therefore thus says the Lord Adonai: “\textit{Because} it was tall in height and it set its treetop between thick clouds, and \textit{he took pride in his tallness},
\verse then I gave it into the hand of the leader of nations; he \textit{dealt thoroughly} with it according to its wickedness. I drove it out.
\verse And strangers cut it off, the most ruthless of nations, and they abandoned it. On the mountains and in all of the valleys its branches fell, and its branches were broken in all the river channels of the land, and all the peoples of the world went out from its shadow, and they abandoned it.
\verse On its fallen trunk all the birds of the heaven now dwell, and all the animals of the field were on its branches.
\verse This occurred so that all of the trees with abundant water will not become tall, and they will not set their treetop between their thick foliage, and so that\textit{all of the trees that are abundantly watered} \textit{will not stand up to them} in their tallness, for all of them, they have been given over to death, to the world below in the midst of \textit{mortals}, to the people going down to the grave.”
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai: “On the day of its going down to Sheol, I caused mourning; I covered over it with the deep, and I withheld its rivers, and many waters were restrained, and I brought gloom over it; Lebanon and all of the trees of the field, they had fainted because of it.
\verse From the sound of its downfall I caused nations to shake when I made it go down to Sheol, with the people going down to the grave, and so in the world below all of the trees of Eden, the choice and the best of Lebanon, \textit{all the well-watered trees} were comforted!
\verse They also went down with it to Sheol to \textit{those who died by the sword}, and its army who had lived in its shadow in the midst of nations.
\verse \textit{To whom could you be compared, whether in glory or in majesty} among the trees of Eden? And yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the world below; in the midst of the uncircumcised you will lie with \textit{those who died by the sword}.

\verse And \textit{in front of} the chambers was a passageway ten cubits in width toward the inside, a walkway of one cubit, and their doorways were to the north.
\verse And the upper chambers narrowed, for the galleries took away space from them more than they took from the lower levels and more than they took from the middle level in the building.
\verse For they were three stories and \textit{they had no pillars} like the pillars of the courtyards; therefore they were smaller than the lower stories and than the middle stories from the ground up.

\verse And the appearance of the vision which I saw was as the vision which I saw at his coming to destroy the city, and these visions were also as the vision which I saw by the \textit{Kebar River}, and I fell on my face.

\verse Now let them send their fornication far away and the offerings for the dead of their kings away from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them \textit{forever}.
\verse You, son of man, describe to the house of Israel the temple and let them be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the pattern.
\verse And if they are ashamed of all that they did, then the plan of the temple and its arrangement and its exits and its entrances and all of its plans and all of its statutes. And all of its plans and all of its laws make known to them and write them before their eyes, so that they may remember all of its plans and all of its statutes, so that they do them!
\verse This is the law of the temple: On the top of the mountain, all of its territory, \textit{all the way around it}, \textit{will be most holy}. Look, this is the law of the temple.
\verse And these are the measurements of the altar in the cubits (a cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth): now its gutter \textit{is a cubit in depth by a cubit in width} and its rim along its edge all around is one span, and this is also the height of the altar.
\verse And from the gutter at the ground up to the lower ledge is two cubits, and its width is one cubit, and from the small ledge up to the large ledge is four cubits, and its width is one cubit.
\verse And the altar hearth was four cubits, and from the altar hearth and \textit{upwards} were the four horns of the altar.

\verse And you must take the bull, the sin offering, and you must burn it in the designated place of the temple outside of the holy place.
\verse And on the second day you must offer a he-goat without defect as a sin offering, and they must purify the altar \textit{like} they purified with the bull.

\verse Seven days they must purify the altar and they must cleanse it and so \textit{they will consecrate it}.

\verse The prince, he may sit in it to eat food \textit{before} Adonai; he will come from the way of the portico of the gate and by means of its way he will also go out.”
\verse Then he brought me by the way of the gate of the north to the front of the temple, and I looked, and look! The glory of Adonai filled the temple of Adonai, and I fell on my face.
\verse And Adonai said, “Son of man, set your heart and look with your eyes and with your ears hear \textit{everything} I am saying to you concerning all the statutes of the temple of Adonai and concerning all its laws, and you must listen with your heart concerning the entrance of the temple with all of the exits of the sanctuary.

\verse And they will teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is unholy, and the difference between unclean and clean they must show them.
\verse And at a legal dispute they themselves shall stand to judge; employing my judgments they shall judge it, and with respect to my laws and my statutes. All my festivals they shall keep and my Sabbaths they shall consecrate.

\verse And he brought me out by the way of the north gate and he led me around by the \textit{way leading to the outside of the outer gate} by way of the gate facing east, and look, there was water trickling from the south side.
\verse As the man went eastward a measuring line was in his hand, and he measured a thousand \textit{cubits}. And he led me through on into the water; it was \textit{ankle deep}.
\verse And he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me over into the waters and it was \textit{knee deep}. And he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me over into the waters and it was \textit{waist deep}.
\verse And he measured a thousand cubits, and it became a stream that I was not able to cross, because the water rose, \textit{waters a person could swim in}, and became a stream that could not be crossed.
\verse And he asked me, “Son of man, did you see this?” And he made me go, and he brought me back along the bank of the stream.
\verse \textit{When I returned}, then look! On the bank of the river were many trees \textit{on both sides}.
\verse And he said to me, “These waters are going out to the eastern region, and they go down to the \textit{Jordan Valley}, and they come to the sea and flow into the sea where \textit{they issue out}, and the waters in the sea will be healed.
\verse And then every living creature with which it teems, \textit{to every place the waters come} it will live; and very many fish will live because these waters came there, and so the water will be healed and everything will be alive \textit{everywhere that} \textit{the stream will come}.
\verse And then fishers from En Gedi and on up to En Eglaim will stand beside it, a sea-girt drying yard for nets; their fish for the dragnets will be \textit{of every kind}, like the fish of the great sea, and very many.
\verse But its marshes and its swamps will not be cured, for they were given for salt.
\verse And along the stream will go up on its banks \textit{from both sides} every tree \textit{producing food}; its leaf will not wither and it will not cease producing its fruit. \textit{Every month} it will bear early fruit, for its waters are going out from the sanctuary, and its fruit will be as food, and its leaf for healing.”
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai: “This is the boundary by which you shall distribute the land for \textit{the twelve} tribes of Israel: Two shares shall be for Joseph.
\verse And you must take possession of it, each one a share like his brother, of this land which \textit{I swore} to give it to your fathers, and so this land shall fall to you as an inheritance.
\verse And this is the boundary of the land: \textit{On the north side}, from the great sea by the way of Hethlon \textit{until you come to Zedad},
\verse Hamath to Berothath to Sibraim, which is between the boundary of Damascus and the boundary of Hamath, on to Hazer Hatticon, which is on the boundary of Hauran.
\verse And so the boundary will be from the sea to Hazar Enan at the boundary of Damascus northwards and the boundary of Hamath to the north, and this is the boundary on the side of the north.
\verse \textit{And the eastern boundary} will be between Hauran and Damascus, and from between Gilead and the land of Israel along the Jordan River from the boundary on the eastern sea to Tamar. And \textit{this is the border on the east}.
\verse \textit{And on the south side the border} will run from Tamar up to the waters of Meribot Kadesh and along the wadi to the Great Sea. And this is \textit{the boundary to the south}.
\verse \textit{And on the west side} the Great Sea shall be the boundary up to opposite Lebo-Hamath. \textit{This is the western boundary}.
\verse You shall divide this land for yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
\verse And then you shall allocate it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the aliens dwelling as aliens in the midst of you who have children in the midst of you, and so they shall be to you just like full citizens among the \textit{Israelites}. With you they shall be allotted with an inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel.
\verse And then in the tribe in which an alien who is with you dwells, there you shall give his inheritance,” \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.
