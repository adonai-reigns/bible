\verseWithHeading{Date of Vision of Living Creatures and Glory of the Throne of Adonai} And it was in \textit{the} thirtieth year, in the fourth \textit{month}, on the fifth \textit{day} of the month, and I \textit{was} in the midst of the exiles by the \textit{Kebar River}. The heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
\verse On the fifth \textit{day} of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of the king Jehoiachin—
\verse the word of Adonai \textit{came} clearly to Ezekiel the son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of \textit{the} Chaldeans at the \textit{Kebar River}, and the hand of Adonai was on him there.
\verse And I looked, and look! A storm wind \textit{was} coming from the north, a great cloud, and fire flashing back and forth, and brightness around \textit{and} \textit{within it}, and from its midst \textit{it was} like \textit{the} outward appearance of amber stone from the midst of the fire.
\verse And from its midst \textit{was} the likeness of four living creatures, and this \textit{was} their appearance: \textit{a human form},
\verse and \textit{each had four faces}, and \textit{each of them had four wings}.
\verse And their legs \textit{were} straight legs, and the sole of their feet \textit{was} like the sole of \textit{the} foot of a calf, and \textit{they} were sparkling like the outward appearance of polished bronze.
\verse And under their wings \textit{were} \textit{human hands} on their four sides. And their faces and their wings for the four of them \textit{were as follows}:
\verse \textit{their wings were touching one another}; \textit{each of them went straight forward}, \textit{without turning right or left}.
\verse The likeness of their faces \textit{was the} face of a human \textit{in front}, and \textit{the} face of a lion on the right \textit{of each of them}, and the face of an ox on the left \textit{of each of them}, and \textit{the} face of an eagle \textit{for each of them}.
\verse So \textit{were} their faces; their wings \textit{were} spread out \textit{upward}; each \textit{had} two touching one another and two covering their bodies.
\verse And each \textit{went straight forward}; \textit{wherever the spirit went} they went, \textit{and} \textit{they did not turn as they went}.
\verse As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance \textit{was} like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. It \textit{was} moving to and fro between the living creatures, and \textit{the fire was very bright} and lightning \textit{was} going out from the fire.
\verse And the living creatures \textit{were speeding to and fro} like the appearance of lightning.
\verse And I saw the living creatures, and look! A wheel was on the earth beside \textit{each of the living creatures that had four faces}.
\verse The appearance of the wheels and their construction \textit{was} like \textit{the} appearance of beryl, and \textit{they all looked alike}, and their appearance and their construction \textit{was} \textit{like a wheel within a wheel}.
\verse When they moved, they went toward their four sides; they did not \textit{veer at all as they went}.
\verse And their rims \textit{were high and awesome}, and \textit{all four of} their rims \textit{were} full of eyes \textit{all} around.
\verse And at the going of the living creatures, the wheels next to them \textit{also} went, and \textit{when the creatures were lifted from the ground} the wheels \textit{also} rose.
\verse \textit{Wherever} the spirit went they would go there, and the wheels rose, for the spirit of the living creatures \textit{was} in the wheels.
\verse At their going, they go, and at their standing, they stood, and at their being lifted up from on the earth, the wheels rose, for the spirit of the living creatures \textit{was} in the wheels.
\verse Now \textit{the} likeness above the heads of the living creatures \textit{was} an expanse like the outward appearance of \textit{awesome} \textit{ice} spread out above their heads \textit{upward}.
\verse And under the expanse their wings \textit{were stretched out} straight \textit{one toward the other}; each had two \textit{wings} covering them, and each had two \textit{wings} covering their bodies.
\verse And I heard the sound of their wings like \textit{the} sound of many waters, like the voice of Shaddai, \textit{and} \textit{when they moved} \textit{there was} a sound of tumult like \textit{the} sound of an army; \textit{when they stood still} they lowered their wings.
\verse And there was a sound from above the expanse that \textit{was} above their heads, \textit{and when they stood} they lowered their wings.
\verse And from above the expanse that \textit{was} above their heads \textit{there was} the likeness of a throne, \textit{looking like a sapphire}, and above the likeness of the throne \textit{was} a likeness similar to \textit{the} appearance of a human on it, \textit{but} \textit{above it}.
\verse And I saw \textit{something} like \textit{the} outward appearance of amber, \textit{something} like \textit{the} appearance of fire, \textit{with} a covering around \textit{it}, from the likeness of his loins and \textit{upward}. And from the likeness of his loins and \textit{downward} I saw \textit{something} like \textit{the} appearance of fire, and \textit{it was radiant all around}.
\verse Like the appearance of a bow that is in the cloud on \textit{a rainy day}, such \textit{was} the radiance around it; \textit{thus was} the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Adonai. And I saw, and I fell on my face, and I heard a voice speaking.

\verseWithHeading{The Call of Ezekiel to Speak God’s Words} And he said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, so that I can speak with you.”
\verse And \textit{the} Spirit came into me as he was speaking to me, and it set me on my feet, and I heard the one speaking to me.
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the \textit{Israelites}, to nations \textit{who are} rebelling, who rebelled against me, they and their ancestors, they transgressed against me \textit{until this very day}.
\verse And the children \textit{are} \textit{impudent} and \textit{stubborn}, \textit{and so} I am sending you to them, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai!’
\verse And they, whether they listen or whether they fail \textit{to listen}, for they \textit{are} a rebellious house, they will know that a prophet was in their midst.
\verse And you, son of man, you must not be afraid of them, and you must not be afraid of their words, because briers and thorns \textit{are} with you, and you \textit{are} sitting among scorpions. You must not be afraid of their words, and you must not be dismayed because of their \textit{looks}, for they \textit{are} a rebellious house.
\verse And you must speak my words to them whether they listen or whether they fail \textit{to listen}, for they \textit{are} rebellious.
\verse And you, son of man, hear what I \textit{am} speaking to you: you must not be rebellious like \textit{the} house of rebellion. Open your mouth and eat what I \textit{am} giving to you.”
\verse And I looked, and look! There was a hand stretched out to me, and look! In it \textit{was} \textit{a scroll with writing}.
\verse And he rolled it out \textit{before me}, and it \textit{was} written \textit{on the} front and back, and there \textit{were} written on it laments and mourning and wailing.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Ezekiel 3
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, what you find, eat! Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.”
\verse And I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat,
\verse and he said to me, “Son of man, you must give your stomach \textit{this} to eat, and you must fill your belly \textit{with} this scroll that I \textit{am} giving to you.” And I ate, and it became \textit{like sweet honey} in my mouth.
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, come! Go to the house of Israel, and you must speak to them with my words.
\verse For you are sent to the house of Israel, not to a people \textit{of obscure speech} and \textit{of a difficult language},
\verse \textit{and} not to many nations \textit{of obscure speech} and \textit{a difficult language} \textit{whose words} you do not understand, \textit{for} if I had sent you to them they would have listened to you.
\verse And the house of Israel, they are not willing to listen to you, for they \textit{are} not willing to listen to me, for all of the house of Israel is hard of forehead, and they \textit{are} hard of heart.
\verse \textit{But} look, I have made your face hard \textit{against} their faces and your forehead hard \textit{against} their forehead.
\verse Like a diamond \textit{harder than flint} I have made your forehead; you must not fear them, and you must not be dismayed \textit{on account of them}, for they \textit{are a rebellious house}.
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, all of my words that I shall speak to you, receive into your heart and hear with your ears.
\verse And come, go to the exiles, to the children of your people, and you must speak to them, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai!’ whether they listen or whether they fail \textit{to listen}.”
\verse And the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake when the glory of Adonai rose from its place.
\verse And \textit{it was} the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching lightly \textit{one against the other}, and the sound of the wheels beside them and \textit{the} sound of a great earthquake.
\verse And \textit{the} Spirit lifted me and took me, and I went \textit{in} bitterness in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Adonai \textit{was} strong on me.
\verse And I went to the exiles \textit{at} Tel Abib, who \textit{were} dwelling near the \textit{Kebar River}, and I sat \textit{where} they \textit{were} dwelling. I sat there seven days in the midst of them, stunned.
\verse And then it happened at \textit{the} end of seven days, \textit{the word of Adonai came} to me, saying,
\verse “Son of man, I have appointed you \textit{as} a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear a word from my mouth, then you must warn them from me.
\verse \textit{When I say} to the wicked, ‘Surely you will die,’ and you do not warn him and you do not speak to warn \textit{the} wicked from his wicked way \textit{so that he may live}, that wicked \textit{person} will die because of his guilt, and from your hand I will seek his blood.
\verse And you, if you do warn \textit{the} wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness and from his wicked way, on account of his guilt he will die, and you yourself will have saved your life.
\verse And \textit{when the righteous turns from his righteousness} and does injustice, and I place a stumbling block \textit{before him}, he will die, for you did not warn him. Because of his sin he will die, and his righteousness that he did will not be remembered, and his blood I shall seek from your hand.
\verse And if you warn him, the righteous, not to sin, and \textit{the} righteous does not sin, surely he will live, for he heeded a warning. And you will have saved your life.”
\verse And the hand of Adonai was on me there, and he said to me, “Rise up, go out to the valley, and there I will speak with you.”
\verse And I rose up, and I went to the valley, and, look, there the glory of Adonai \textit{was} standing, like the glory that I saw near the \textit{Kebar River}, and I fell on my face.
\verse And \textit{the} Spirit came into me, and it made me stand on my feet, and he spoke with me and said to me, “Come, shut yourself \textit{inside your house},
\verse and you, son of man, look, they will place cords on you, and they will tie you up with them. Then you will not go out into the midst of them.
\verse And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, and you will be silenced, and you will not be a reproving man for them, for they \textit{are a rebellious house}.
\verse And when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai: “The \textit{one} hearing him, let him hear, and the \textit{one} failing \textit{to hear}, let him fail,” ’ for they \textit{are a rebellious house}.

\verseWithHeading{Siege of Jerusalem Illustrated on a Brick} “Now, son of man, take for yourself a brick, and you must put it \textit{before you}, and you must portray on it a city, Jerusalem.
\verse And you must build against it siege works, and you must build against it \textit{a} bulwark, and you must heap against it a siege ramp, and you must set up against it camps and put against it a battering ram all around.
\verse And take for yourself a plate of iron, and you must place it \textit{as} a wall of iron between you and the city, and you must set your face against it, and it must be \textit{under siege}, and you must lay the siege against it; it is a sign for the house of Israel.
\verse And you, lie down on your left side, and you must put the guilt of the house of Israel on it. You will carry their guilt the number of days that you will lie on it.
\verse And I will give to you the years of their guilt according to \textit{the} number of \textit{the} days, three hundred and ninety days, and you must bear the guilt of the house of Israel.
\verse When you have completed these, then you must lie a second \textit{time} on your right side; and you must bear the guilt of the house of Judah forty days, a day for each year, a day for each year I give it to you.
\verse And toward the siege of Jerusalem you must set your face and your bared arm; then you must prophesy against it.
\verse Now look! I \textit{will} put on you cords, and you may not turn yourself from \textit{one} side to your \textit{other} side until you complete the days of your siege.
\verseWithHeading{Ezekiel’s Strange Defiled Meal} “And you, take for yourself wheat and barley and beans and lentils and millet and spelt, and you must put them in one vessel, and you must make them for yourself into a food \textit{during} the number of days that you \textit{are} lying on your side; three hundred and ninety days you shall eat it.
\verse And your food that you will eat \textit{will be} according to weight; twenty shekels for each day \textit{at fixed times} you shall eat it.
\verse And \textit{an amount of water} you shall drink, a sixth of a hin; \textit{at fixed times} you shall drink \textit{it}.
\verse And \textit{as a} bread-cake of barley you shall eat it, and \textit{with human excrement} you shall bake it before their eyes.”
\verse And Adonai said, “Thus shall the \textit{Israelites} eat their unclean food among the nations \textit{where I will scatter them}.”
\verse And I said, “Ah, Lord Adonai! Look! I have not been defiling myself, and a dead body and mangled carcass I have not eaten from my childhood until now, and \textit{unclean meat} has not come into my mouth!”
\verse And he said to me, “See I will give you \textit{cattle manure} in the place of the feces of a human, and you may prepare your food on it.”
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, look, I \textit{am} going to break the \textit{supply} of bread in Jerusalem, and they will eat bread by weight, \textit{anxiously}, and \textit{rationed water}, and they will drink with horror,
\verse so that they will lack food and water, and they will be appalled \textit{with one another}, and they will waste away because of their guilt.

\verse “And you, son of man, take for yourself a sword, sharp \textit{as} \textit{a barber’s razor}. Take it for yourself, and you must cause \textit{it} to pass over your head and over your beard, and you must take for yourself a set of scales for weighing, and you must divide them.
\verse A third you must burn with fire in the midst of the city at \textit{the completion} of the days of the siege, and you must take a third, and you must strike \textit{it} with the sword around it, and a third you must scatter to the wind, and I will draw a sword behind them.
\verse And you must take from these a few in number, and you must tuck them in your hem.
\verse And from them again you shall take \textit{some}, and you must throw them in the middle of the fire, and you must burn them with fire; from it a fire will go out to all of the house of Israel.
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai: This \textit{is} Jerusalem in the midst of the nations \textit{where} I have put her, and countries \textit{are} around her.
\verse But she has rebelled against my regulations to the point of wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that \textit{are} around her; for they rejected my regulations, and \textit{as for} my statutes, they did not walk in them.
\verse Therefore, thus says the Lord Adonai: Because of your commotion more than the nations that \textit{are} around you—you did not walk in my statutes, and you did not do my regulations, and according to the regulations of the nations that \textit{are} around you, you did not do.
\verse Therefore thus says the Lord Adonai: Look! I, \textit{even I}, am against you, and I will execute judgment in the midst of you before the eyes of the nations,
\verse and I will do with you \textit{that} which I have not done, and which I will not do again, because of all of your detestable things.
\verse Therefore parents will eat children in the midst of you, and children will eat their parents, and I will execute judgment in you, and I will scatter your entire remnant to every wind.
\verse Therefore \textit{as surely as I live}, \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai, \textit{Surely} because you have defiled my sanctuary with all of your vile idols and with all of your detestable things, \textit{now indeed I} will reduce, and my eye will not take pity, and surely I will show no compassion.
\verse A third of you will die because of the plague, and because of the famine they will perish in the midst of you, and a third will fall through the sword around you, and a third I will scatter to every direction of the wind, and I will draw \textit{the} sword behind them.
\verse And my anger will come to an end, and I will place my rage on them, and I will relent, and they will know that I, Adonai, have spoken in my passion \textit{when I fully vent my rage against them}.
\verse And I will make you into a desolate place and into a disgrace among the nations that surround you before the eyes of \textit{every one who passes by}.
\verse And it will be \textit{an} object of taunting and \textit{an} object of mockery, a warning and a horror to the nations that \textit{are} around you whenever I execute judgments against you in anger and in wrath and in furious punishments! I, Adonai, have spoken!
\verse When I send my arrows of deadly famine against them, which will be as destruction that I will send \textit{in order} to destroy you, I will increase famine against you, and I will break \textit{the supply of food} for you.
\verse And I will send against you famine and fierce animals, and they will make you childless; and plague and blood will pass through you, and I will bring \textit{the} sword upon you. I, Adonai, I have spoken!”

\verseWithHeading{Idolatrous Worship and Idolatrous Objects Denounced} And the word of Adonai \textit{came} to me, saying,
\verse “Son of man, set your face to the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them,
\verse and you must say, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Adonai, thus says the Lord Adonai to the mountains and to the hills, to the ravines and to the valleys: “Look, I \textit{am} bringing upon you \textit{the} sword, and I will destroy your high places,
\verse and your altars will be desolate, and your incense altars will be broken, and I will throw down your slain ones \textit{before} your idols,
\verse and I will place the corpses of the children of Israel \textit{before} their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars.
\verse In all of your dwellings, the cities will be desolate and the high places will be ruined, so that your altars will be desolate and will suffer punishment. Your idols will be broken and will come to an end, and your incense altars will be cut down, and your works will be destroyed,
\verse and the slain one will fall in the midst of you, and \textit{then} you will know that I \textit{am} Adonai.
\verse But I will spare \textit{some}, \textit{so there will be} for you fugitives from \textit{the} sword among the nations \textit{when you are scattered} in the countries.
\verse And your fugitives will remember me among the nations \textit{to} which they were taken captive, that I was shattered by \textit{their adulterous heart} which departed from me, and by \textit{their adulterous eyes} which \textit{went} after their idols, and they will feel loathing \textit{for themselves}, for the evil that they did, for all of their detestable things.
\verse And they will know that I \textit{am} Adonai; not \textit{in vain} I spoke to bring to them this evil.” ’
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai: ‘Clap your hand and stamp with your foot, and say, “Alas, for all of the detestable things of the evil of the house of Israel, \textit{because of which} they will fall with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague.
\verse The one who is far \textit{away} will die by the plague, and the one who is near will fall by the sword, and the one who is being left behind and being spared will die by the famine, and I will complete my rage on them.
\verse And you will know that I \textit{am} Adonai \textit{when their slain ones are in the midst of their idols} around their altars at every high hill, on the tops of all the mountains and under every green tree and under every leafy oak—the place \textit{at} which they gave \textit{a} pleasing scent for all of their idols.

\verseWithHeading{Punishment for Abominations Throughout the Land} And the word of Adonai \textit{came} to me, saying,

\verse Violence has grown to \textit{become} a staff of wickedness; \textit{none} from them \textit{will remain}, and \textit{none} from their abundance nor from their wealth; and prominence \textit{will} not \textit{be} among them.
\verse The time has come, the day has arrived; let not the buyer rejoice, and let the seller not mourn, for anger \textit{is} on all their multitude.
\verse For the seller will not return to the merchandise \textit{while they are still alive}, for the vision \textit{is} about all of its multitude; it will not change, and a man because of his guilt will not be able to hold onto his life.

\verse And \textit{if} their survivors will escape, they will be on the mountains, like the doves of the valley, all of them groaning, each because of his guilt.
\verse All of the hands will hang limp, and all of \textit{the knees will be wet with urine}.
\verse And they will wear sackcloth, and horror will cover them, and on all of \textit{the} faces \textit{will be} shame, and baldness on all of their heads.

\verseWithHeading{Abominations in the Temple and in Jerusalem} \textit{And then} in the sixth year, in the sixth \textit{month}, on the fifth \textit{day} of the month, I \textit{was} sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah \textit{were} sitting \textit{before me}. And the hand of the Lord Adonai fell on me there,
\verse and I saw, and look! A figure like \textit{the} appearance of a man; from the appearance of his waist and below \textit{was} fire, and from his waist and \textit{upward} \textit{was} like \textit{the} appearance of brightness, like the \textit{outward appearance of} amber.
\verse And he sent out \textit{the} form of a hand, and he took me by a lock of hair of my head, and \textit{the} Spirit lifted me between earth and heaven, and it brought me to Jerusalem in visions of God to the doorway of \textit{the} inner gate \textit{that faced north}, \textit{at} which there \textit{was} the seat of the image of jealousy, which was making jealous.
\verse And look! There \textit{was} the glory of the God of Israel like the vision that I saw in the valley.
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, lift up now your eyes \textit{toward the north}.” And I lifted up my eyes \textit{toward the north}, and, look, \textit{there was} to the north of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy at the entrance.
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, “\textit{Do you see} what they \textit{are} doing—great detestable things that the house of Israel \textit{is} committing here \textit{so as} to drive \textit{me} from my sanctuary, and yet \textit{you will see again} greater detestable things.”
\verse And he brought me to the doorway of the courtyard, and I saw, and look! A hole in the wall.
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, dig now through the wall.” And I dug through the wall, and look! There was a doorway.
\verse And he said to me, “Come and see the detestable things, the evil that they are doing here.
\verse And I came, and I saw, and look, all kinds of creatures and detestable beasts; \textit{and} all of the idols of the house of Israel \textit{were} carved on the wall \textit{all around}.
\verse And seventy men from the elders of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan, \textit{was} standing in the midst of them, \textit{and} \textit{they were} standing \textit{before them}. Each \textit{one} \textit{had} his censer in his hand, and the fragrance of the cloud of the incense \textit{was} going up.
\verse And he said to me, “Have you seen, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel \textit{are} doing in the dark, each in the inner rooms of his idol, for \textit{they are} saying, ‘Adonai \textit{is} not seeing us; Adonai has abandoned the land.’ ”
\verse And he said to me, “Still \textit{you will see again} greater detestable things that they \textit{are} doing.”
\verse And he brought me to the doorway of the gate of the house of Adonai that \textit{is} toward the north, and look! There \textit{were} the women sitting weeping for Tammuz.

\verse And I adorned you \textit{with} ornaments, and I put a bracelet on your arms and a necklace on your neck.
\verse And I put an ornamental ring on your nose and earrings on your ears and a \textit{beautiful crown} on your head.
\verse And you adorned yourself with gold and silver, and your clothing \textit{was} fine linen and costly fabric and beautiful finished cloth; you ate finely milled flour and honey and olive oil, and you became exceedingly beautiful; \textit{you were fit to be a queen}.
\verse And a name went out for you among the nations because of your beauty, for it \textit{was} perfect because of my majesty that I bestowed on you,’ \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.
\verse ‘And you trusted in your beauty, and you prostituted on account of your name, and you poured out your fornication on every \textit{one} passing by, \textit{saying}, “Let it be his.”
\verse And you took from your clothes and you made for yourself colorful shrines, and you prostituted on them; \textit{this had not happened before}, and it \textit{will not continue to happen}.
\verse And you took \textit{your beautiful jewelry} \textit{made} from my gold and from my silver that I had given to you, and you made for yourself \textit{male images}, and you prostituted with them.
\verse And you took the clothes of your beautiful finished cloth, and you covered them and my oil and my incense you set \textit{before them}.
\verse And my bread that I gave to you, finely milled flour and oil and honey \textit{with which} I fed you, then you set it \textit{before them} as a \textit{pleasing odor}, and so it was,’ \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.

\verse “ ‘And then after all of your evil! Woe, woe, to you!’ \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.
\verse ‘And \textit{then} you built for yourself a mound, and you made for yourself a high place in every public square.
\verse At \textit{the} head of every street you built your high place and you disgraced your beauty and you spread your feet for every passerby, and you increased your whoring.
\verse And you prostituted with the \textit{Egyptians}, your neighbors \textit{who were sexually aroused}, and you increased your fornication to provoke me.

\verse “ ‘Therefore, prostitute, hear the word of Adonai.
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai: Because of the pouring out of your shame and \textit{because} your nakedness was revealed in your whoring with your lovers, and on account of all of the idols of your detestable things, and according to the blood of your children whom you gave to them,
\verse therefore, look! I \textit{am} gathering all of your lovers \textit{whom you were pleased about}, and all of whom you loved in addition to all of whom you hated, and I will gather them against you from \textit{everywhere}, and I \textit{will} uncover your nakedness to them, and they will see all of your nakedness.
\verse And I will judge you \textit{with the} judgment of \textit{women} committing adultery and shedding blood, and I will give you \textit{the} blood of rage and jealousy.
\verse And I will give you into their hand, and they will demolish your mound, and they will break down your high places, and they will strip you of your clothes, and they will take \textit{your beautiful jewelry}, and they will leave you naked and bare.
\verse And they will bring up against you a crowd, and they will stone you with stones, and they will cut you to pieces with their swords.
\verse And they will burn your houses with fire, and they will execute against you judgments \textit{before} many women, and I will stop you from prostitution, and also a harlot’s wages you will not give again.

\verse \textit{Because} you did not remember the days of your childhood and you made me angry with all of these. And in turn I, look, I will return your way upon \textit{your} head,’ \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai, ‘and did you not \textit{do} wickedness in addition to all of your detestable things?

\verse You \textit{are} a daughter of your mother \textit{who} abhorred her husband and her children, and you \textit{are} a sister of your sisters who abhorred their husbands and their children. Your mother \textit{was} a Hittite, and your father \textit{was} an Amorite.
\verse And your elder sister, she \textit{is} Samaria, and her daughters, \textit{who are} dwelling on your north, and your younger sister \textit{is} the one dwelling on your south; \textit{she} \textit{is} Sodom and her daughters.
\verse And you have not \textit{only} gone in their ways, but you \textit{also} did according to their detestable things. \textit{In such a short time} you behaved \textit{more} corruptly than they in all of your ways.
\verse \textit{As surely as I live},’ \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai, ‘surely your sister Sodom and her daughters did not \textit{do} as you and your daughters did.
\verse Look! This was the iniquity of Sodom, your sister: Pride, abundance of food, and \textit{prosperous ease} was to her and to her daughters, and \textit{she did not sustain the needy and the poor}.
\verse And they were proud, and they did a detestable thing \textit{before me}, and I removed them \textit{because} I saw \textit{it}.
\verse And Samaria did not sin \textit{according to even half of your sins}, and you caused your detestable things to increase more than they, and you made your sister righteous \textit{in comparison} with all of your detestable things that you did.
\verse Also, you bear your disgrace, \textit{by} which you furnished justification to your sisters through your sins \textit{by} which you acted more abominably than they; they were more righteous than you, and also, you be ashamed and bear your disgrace through your making your sister righteous.
\verse And I will restore their fortune, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and \textit{even} the fortunes of your captivity in the midst of them,
\verse in order that you may bear your disgrace and you may be put to shame because of all that you did at your consoling them.
\verse And \textit{as for} your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, they will return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters, they will return to their former state, and you and your daughters will return to your former state.
\verse And was not Sodom, your sister, a byword in your mouth in the day of your pride
\verse \textit{before} your evil was uncovered? \textit{It was} like the time of the scorn of the daughters of Aram and all \textit{those} around her, and of the daughters of the Philistines, those all around who \textit{are} despising you.
\verse Your wickedness and your detestable things, you, you must bear them,’ \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse ‘For thus says the Lord Adonai: And I will do it to you \textit{according to what you have done}, who despised \textit{the} oath to break covenant.

\verse and you must say, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai: “\textit{The great eagle with great wings and long feathers} \textit{and} \textit{full of variegated plumage} came to Lebanon and he took the treetop of the cedar.
\verse He plucked the top of its new plant shoot, and he brought it to the land of Canaan \textit{and} put it in a city of merchants,
\verse and he took from the seed of the land and placed it in \textit{fertile soil} on many waters; \textit{like} a willow he planted it.
\verse And it sprouted, and \textit{it became a vine spreading out}, low of height, turning its branches to him, and its roots were under it, and \textit{it became a vine}, and it made branches, and it sent out foliage.
\verse “ ‘ “And there was another great eagle, great of wings and \textit{with} abundant plumage, and look! This vine stretched out its roots toward him and extended its branches to him to water it from the garden bed \textit{where it was planted}.
\verse It was planted in \textit{a} good field by many waters to produce branches and to bear fruit to become \textit{a beautiful vine}.” ’
\verse Say, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai: “Will it prosper? Will he not tear out its roots, and will he not make its fruit scaly, and it will wither, and all of the freshness of its vegetation will dry up? And to lift it from its roots \textit{will not require great strength or many people}.
\verse And look! \textit{Though} it is planted, will it prosper? \textit{When the east wind strikes it}, will it not dry up completely? On the garden bed of its vegetation it will dry up!” ’ ”

\verse And he despised \textit{the} oath to break covenant. And, look, he gave his hand \textit{in pledge}, and \textit{yet} he did all of these \textit{things}. He will not escape.’
\verse Therefore thus says the Lord Adonai: ‘\textit{As I live}, \textit{surely} my oath that he despised and my covenant that he broke I will return upon his head.
\verse And I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my hunting net, and I will bring him \textit{to} Babylon, and I will enter into judgment with him there \textit{about} his infidelity that he displayed against me.
\verse And all of his choice troops, among all of his troops, they will fall by the sword, and \textit{those who} \textit{are} remaining, they will be scattered to all \textit{the directions of the} wind, and you will know that I, Adonai, I have spoken.’
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai: ‘And I will take, \textit{even} I, from the treetop of the high cedar, and I will plant \textit{it}, from the head of its new plant shoot I will pluck a tender one, and I will plant \textit{it}, \textit{even} I, on a high and lofty mountain.
\verse On the height of the mountain of Israel I will plant \textit{it}, and it will carry branches, and it will bear fruit, and \textit{it will become a noble cedar}, and all of the birds of all wings will dwell under it in the shade of its branches.
\verse And all of the trees of the field will know that I, Adonai, I will bring low a high tree, \textit{and} I will exalt a low, fresh tree, and I will make a dry tree flourish. I, Adonai, I have spoken, and I will do \textit{it}.’ ”

\verseWithHeading{Oholah and Oholibah as Symbols of God’s Corrupt People} And the word of Adonai \textit{came} to me, \textit{saying},
\verse “Son of man, there were two women, \textit{the} daughters of one mother,
\verse and they prostituted \textit{themselves} in Egypt in their childhood; they were prostituting \textit{themselves} there, \textit{and} their breasts were fondled, and there they caressed the bosoms of their virginity.
\verse Now \textit{as for} their names, the older \textit{was} Oholah, and Oholibah \textit{was} her sister. And \textit{they became mine}, and they bore sons and daughters, and their names \textit{are} Samaria \textit{for} Oholah, and Jerusalem \textit{for} Oholibah.
\verse And Oholah prostituted \textit{herself} \textit{while she was still mine}, and she lusted for her lovers, for Assyria \textit{who was} nearby,
\verse clothed in blue cloth, governors and prefects, \textit{handsome young men} \textit{and} all of them horsemen, \textit{experts on horseback}.
\verse And she bestowed her fornication on them, \textit{on} the choice \textit{ones} of the \textit{Assyrians}, all of them, and with every one \textit{after} which she lusted; with all of their idols she defiled herself.
\verse And her whorings from \textit{the time of} Egypt she \textit{did} not abandon, for they slept with her in her childhood, and they caressed the bosoms of her virginity, and they poured out their fornication on her.
\verse Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the \textit{Assyrians} \textit{after whom she lusted}.
\verse They uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters, and they killed her with the sword. And she became a name for the women, and they executed judgments against her.
\verse “And though Oholibah her sister saw, yet in her lust \textit{she behaved more corruptly than her}, and her whoring \textit{was} more than the prostitution of her sister.
\verse She lusted after the \textit{Assyrians}, governors and prefects, warriors clothed in perfection, \textit{expert horsemen}, all of them \textit{handsome young men}.
\verse And I saw that she was defiled; \textit{they had both taken the same path}!
\verse And she increased her whorings, and she saw men carved on the wall, images of Chaldeans carved in red,

\verse And so the \textit{Babylonians} came to her \textit{for the} bed of lovemaking; and they defiled her with their fornication, and she was defiled by them, and she turned from them.
\verse And she revealed her whorings, and she revealed her nakedness, and so I turned from her \textit{just as} I turned from her sister.
\verse Yet she increased her whorings, \textit{recalling} the days of her childhood when she was prostituted in the land of Egypt.

\verse Also they did this to me: they defiled my sanctuary on that day, and they profaned my Sabbaths,
\verse and when they slaughtered their children for their idols, they came to my sanctuary on that day to profane it. And look, \textit{this is what they did in my house}!
\verse \textit{What is worse}, they sent for men \textit{who come} from a distant place, \textit{to} whom a messenger \textit{was} sent to them, and look! They came! \textit{Men} for whom you bathed and painted your eyes, and you adorned yourself \textit{with} an ornament.
\verse And you sat on a magnificent couch and a table prepared \textit{before her}, and my incense and my olive oil you put on her.
\verse And a sound of a carefree crowd \textit{was} with it, and in addition to \textit{these} men, \textit{a crowd of drunken men was brought in} from \textit{the} desert, and they put bracelets on their arms and a crown of splendor on their heads.
\verse And I said to the one worn out \textit{with} adulteries, ‘Now they will prostitute \textit{her} \textit{concerning} her fornication, even her.’
\verse And \textit{so} they went to her like going to a female prostitute; and thus they went to Oholah and to Oholibah, the women of obscene conduct.
\verse But righteous men, they will judge them \textit{with} \textit{the} judgment of committing adultery, and \textit{with} \textit{the} judgment of shedding blood; for they were committing adultery, and blood \textit{was} on their hands.”

\verse Look! Assyria \textit{was} a cedar in Lebanon, 
\textit{with} beautiful branches and a forest giving shade,

and its treetop \textit{was} between \textit{the} clouds.
\verse Waters made it great, 
the deep made it grow high; 
its rivers \textit{were} going all around \textit{its planting area}, 
and its channels it sent \textit{out}

\verse Therefore it became tall, 
\textit{with} its height more than all of the trees of the field,

\verse In its branches all the birds of the heaven made their nest,

in the length of its branches, 
for its root \textit{was} toward much water.
\verse Cedars in the garden of God 
could not \textit{be} equal to it; 
fir trees could not resemble its branches, 
and plane trees were not \textit{even} like its branches; 
any tree \textit{even} in the garden of God 
could not resemble it in its beauty.
\verse Therefore thus says the Lord Adonai: “\textit{Because} it was tall in height and it set its treetop between thick clouds, and \textit{he took pride in his tallness},
\verse then I gave it into \textit{the} hand of \textit{the} leader of nations; he \textit{dealt thoroughly} with it according to its wickedness. I drove it \textit{out}.
\verse And strangers cut it off, \textit{the most} ruthless of nations, and they abandoned it. On the mountains and in all \textit{of the} valleys its branches fell, and its branches were broken in all the river channels of the land, and all the peoples of the world went out from its shadow, and they abandoned it.
\verse On its fallen trunk all the birds of the heaven \textit{now} dwell, and all the animals of the field were on its branches.
\verse \textit{This occurred} so that all of \textit{the} trees \textit{with abundant} water will not become tall, and they will not set their treetop between \textit{their} thick foliage, and \textit{so that}\textit{all of the trees that are abundantly watered} \textit{will not stand up to them} in their tallness, for all of them, they have been given \textit{over} to death, to \textit{the} world below in the midst of \textit{mortals}, to \textit{the people} going down to the grave.”
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai: “On the day of its going down \textit{to} Sheol, I caused mourning; I covered over it \textit{with} the deep, and I withheld its rivers, and many waters were restrained, and I brought gloom over it; Lebanon and all of the trees of the field, they \textit{had} fainted because of it.
\verse From the sound of its downfall I caused nations to shake when I made it go down to Sheol, with \textit{the people} going down to \textit{the} grave, and \textit{so} in \textit{the} world below all of the trees of Eden, \textit{the} choice and the best of Lebanon, \textit{all the well-watered trees} were comforted!
\verse They also went down with it to Sheol to \textit{those who died by the sword}, and its army \textit{who} \textit{had} lived in its shadow in the midst of nations.
\verse \textit{To whom could you be compared, whether in glory or in majesty} among the trees of Eden? And yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to \textit{the} world below; in the midst of \textit{the} uncircumcised you will lie with \textit{those who died by the sword}.

in \textit{the} assembly of many peoples, 
and I will bring you up in my dragnet.
\verse And I will throw you on the ground; 
on the surface of the open field I will hurl you, 
and I will cause every bird of the heaven to dwell on you, 
and I will satisfy the animals of all of the world from you.
\verse And I will put your flesh on the mountains, 
and I will fill the valleys \textit{with} your carcass.
\verse And I will water \textit{the} land \textit{with} your discharge from your blood 
on the mountains, 
and valleys will be filled from you.
\verse And I will cover \textit{you} at extinguishing your heavens, 
and I will make dark their stars, 
and I will cover \textit{the} sun with the cloud, 
and \textit{the} moon will not give its light. \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.
\verse “And I will disturb \textit{the} hearts of many peoples 
at my bringing \textit{about} your captivity among the nations, 
to countries that you do not know.
\verse And I will cause many peoples to be awestruck over you, 
and their kings will shudder over you \textit{in} horror, 
at my brandishing my sword before their faces, 
and they will tremble \textit{continually}, 
each \textit{person} for his life, 
on the day of your downfall.”
\verse For thus says the Lord Adonai:
\verse “The sword of the king of Babylon, 
it will come to you.
\verse By the swords of warriors I will cause to fall your hordes 
\textit{by} \textit{the most} ruthless of \textit{the} nations, all of them, 
and they will devastate the majesty of Egypt, 
and all of its hordes will be destroyed.
\verse And I will destroy all her domestic livestock 
\textit{beside} many waters. 
\textit{The} feet of humans will not make them turbid again, 
and \textit{the} hooves of domestic livestock will not make them turbid. \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.
\verse “Then I make the land of Egypt \textit{a} desolation, 
so that the land will be stripped from its fullness 
when I strike all of \textit{those} dwelling in it, 
and they will know that I \textit{am} Adonai.
\verse \textit{This is} a lament, and they will chant it as a lament; the daughters \textit{of} the nations will chant it as a lament over Egypt, and over all of its hordes they will chant it as a lament,” \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.
\verse \textit{And then} in the \textit{twelfth} year, \textit{on the fifteenth} \textit{day} of the month, the word of Adonai \textit{came} to me, \textit{saying},

\verse \textit{The} chiefs of \textit{the} warriors will speak to him from the middle of Sheol; with his helpers they have gone down; the uncircumcised lie \textit{still}, \textit{those slain by the sword}.
\verse Assyria \textit{is} there and all of its assembly; all around it \textit{are} its graves, all of them killed, those fallen by the sword,
\verse who will be given its graves in \textit{the} remote areas of \textit{the} pit, and its assembly will be all around its grave, all of them killed, fallen by the sword, \textit{those} who spread terror in \textit{the} land of \textit{the} living.
\verse Elam \textit{is} there and all of its hordes, all around its grave, all of them dead who fell by the sword, \textit{those} who went down uncircumcised to \textit{the} depths of \textit{the} underworld, \textit{those} who spread their terror to \textit{the} land of \textit{the} living, and \textit{now} they bear their disgrace with \textit{the people} going down \textit{to the} grave.
\verse In the midst of \textit{the} slain they made a bed for her with all of her hordes all around its graves, all of them uncircumcised, slain by \textit{the} sword, for their terror was spread in \textit{the} land of \textit{the} living, and they \textit{now} bear their disgrace with \textit{the people} going down to \textit{the} grave; in the midst of \textit{the} slain it was placed.
\verse Meshech \textit{and} Tubal \textit{are} there and all of its hordes, all around him its graves, all of them uncircumcised \textit{and} killed by \textit{the} sword, for they gave their terror in \textit{the} land of \textit{the} living.
\verse And they do not lie with warriors fallen from long ago, who went down \textit{to} Sheol with their weapons of war, and they placed their sword under their heads, and their shields were on their bones, for \textit{the} terror of \textit{the} warriors \textit{was} in \textit{the} land of the living.
\verse And you \textit{too} in the midst of uncircumcised \textit{people} will be broken, and you will lie with \textit{those} slain by \textit{the} sword.
\verse There \textit{is} Edom, its kings and all of its leaders who are laid \textit{along} with their might with \textit{those} killed by \textit{the} sword; they will lie with \textit{the} uncircumcised and with \textit{the people} going down to the grave.
\verse There are \textit{also} the princes of \textit{the} north, all of them, all of \textit{the} Sidonians who have gone down, being ashamed \textit{to lie} with \textit{the} slain because of their terror \textit{that they caused} from their might, and they lie uncircumcised with \textit{those killed} by \textit{the} sword, and they bear their disgrace \textit{along with} \textit{the people} going down to \textit{the} grave.
\verse Pharaoh will see them, and he will be comforted over all of his hordes killed by \textit{the} sword, Pharaoh and all of his army,” \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.
\verse “For he spread my terror in \textit{the} land of \textit{the} living, and \textit{so} he will be laid down in the midst of the uncircumcised with those killed by \textit{the} sword: Pharaoh and all of his hordes,”\textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.

\verse and he sees the sword coming against the land, and he blows on the horn and he warns the people,
\verse and \textit{anyone who listens} hears the sound of the horn and \textit{he does not take warning} and \textit{the} sword comes and it takes him, his blood will be on his \textit{own} head.
\verse \textit{For} he heard the sound of the horn and he did not take warning; his blood will be on him. But \textit{if} he took warning, he saved his life.
\verse And \textit{as for} the watchman, if he sees the sword coming and \textit{he does not blow} the horn, and the people \textit{are} not warned, and \textit{the} sword comes and it takes \textit{their lives}, he will be taken through his guilt, but his blood from the hand of the watchman I will seek.’
\verse “And you, son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; if you hear a word from my mouth, then you must warn them from me.
\verse \textit{When I say} to the wicked, ‘Wicked \textit{one}, you will certainly die,’ and you \textit{did not speak} to warn \textit{the} wicked from his way, he, \textit{the} wicked, will die by his guilt, but his blood I will seek from your hand.
\verse But, you, if you warn \textit{the} wicked from his way, to turn from it, and \textit{he does not turn} from his way, he will die by his guilt, and you will have saved your life.
\verse “And you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, \textit{saying}, ‘So you said, \textit{saying}, “Indeed, our transgressions and our sins \textit{are} on us, and because of them we \textit{are} rotting, and how can we live?” ’
\verse Say to them, ‘\textit{As I live},’ \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai, ‘\textit{Surely I have no delight} in the death of the wicked, \textit{except} in \textit{the} wicked returning from his way, and he lives. Turn back! Turn back from your ways, O evil \textit{ones}, for why should you die, house of Israel?’
\verse “So you, son of man, say to \textit{your people} \textit{that} the righteousness of the righteous shall not save him in the day of his transgression, and the wickedness of the wicked \textit{will not cause him to stumble} on the day of his returning from his wickedness; and \textit{the} righteous will not be able to live by it on the day when he returns to his sin.
\verse When I say to the righteous, ‘Certainly he will live,’ and he trusted in his righteousness, and he \textit{turns and he} does injustice, all of his righteousness will not be remembered, and because of his injustice that he did, because of it he will die.
\verse And when I say to the wicked, ‘Certainly you will die,’ but he returns from his sin and he does justice and righteousness—
\verse \textit{for example}, \textit{the} wicked returns a pledge for a loan, he restores \textit{stolen property}, he goes in the statutes of life \textit{so as} not to do injustice—certainly he will live; he will not die.
\verse All of his \textit{sins that he committed}, they will not be remembered against him, and he did justice and righteousness; certainly he will live.
\verse “Yet \textit{your people} say, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair!’ \textit{yet} their way is not fair.
\verse When \textit{the} righteous turns from his righteousness and does injustice, then he will die \textit{because of it}.
\verse And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and he does justice and righteousness, because of it \textit{he will certainly live}!
\verse Yet you said, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair!’ I will judge you, house of Israel, each \textit{person} according to his ways.”

\verse And I will make the land \textit{a} desolation and \textit{a} wasteland, and the pride of its strength will come to an end, and the mountains of Israel will be desolate \textit{with no one traveling through them}.” ’
\verse And they will know that I \textit{am} Adonai when I make my land \textit{a} desolation and \textit{a} wasteland, because of all of their detestable things that they have done.
\verse “And you, son of man, \textit{your people}, the ones talking together concerning you beside the walls and in the doorways of the houses, each one with his brother \textit{saying}, ‘Please come and hear what \textit{is} the word \textit{that is going out from Adonai}.’

\verse The fat you eat, and you clothe \textit{yourself} \textit{with} the wool; the well-nourished \textit{animals} you slaughter, \textit{but} you do not feed the flock.

\verse And they were scattered \textit{without} a shepherd, and they were as food for all the animals of the field \textit{when} they were scattered.
\verse My flock went astray upon all of the mountains and on every high hill, and \textit{so} upon all the surface of the world my flock were scattered, and \textit{there was no one seeking them}, and \textit{there was no one searching for them}.”

\verse And I will bring them out from the peoples, and I will gather them from the countries, and I will bring them to their soil, and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the valleys, and in all of the settlements of the land.
\verse I will feed them in good pasture, and their pasture will be on the mountains of the heights of Israel; there they will lie down in good pasture, and \textit{on} lush pasture they will feed on the mountains of Israel.
\verse \textit{I myself} will feed my flock and \textit{I myself} will allow them to lie down,” \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.
\verse “I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the scattered, and I will bind \textit{up} the one hurt, and I will strengthen the sick; and the fat and the strong I will destroy. I will feed her with justice.”

\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I said, “Lord Adonai, you know.”
\verse And he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones, and you must say to them, \textit{to} the dry bones, ‘Hear the word of Adonai!
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai to these bones: “Look! I \textit{am} bringing into you breath, and you will live!
\verse And I will lay on you sinews, and I will let flesh come upon you, and I will cover you over \textit{with} skin, and I will put breath into you, and you will live, and you will know that I \textit{am} Adonai.” ’ ”
\verse And I prophesied \textit{just as} I had been commanded, and \textit{there} was a sound at my prophesying, and look! A rattling, and they came together—\textit{the} bones! Bone to its bone!
\verse And I looked, and indeed, sinews \textit{were} on them, and flesh went up, and skin covered over them \textit{upward}, but breath \textit{was} not in them.
\verse And he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and you must say to the breath, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai \textit{from the four winds}, “Come, O spirit and breath, on these dead ones, so that they may live!” ’ ”
\verse And I prophesied \textit{as} he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they became alive, and they stood on their feet, a very, very large group.
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, these bones \textit{are} all of the house of Israel; look! \textit{they are} saying, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is destroyed; \textit{we are cut off as far as we are concerned}.’
\verse Therefore prophesy, and you must say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai: “Look! I \textit{am} opening your graves, and I will bring you up from your graves, my people, and I will bring you to the land of Israel!
\verse And you will know that I \textit{am} Adonai when I open your graves when I bring you up from your graves, my people!
\verse And I will put my breath into you so that you may live, and I will cause you to rest on your soil, and you will know that I, Adonai, I have spoken, and I will act!” ’ \textit{declares} Adonai.”
\verse And the word of Adonai \textit{came} to me, \textit{saying},
\verse “And you, son of man, take for yourself \textit{a piece of wood}, and write on it, ‘For Judah and for the \textit{Israelites} his associates,’ and take another \textit{piece of} wood, and write on it, ‘For Joseph, \textit{the piece of} wood of Ephraim and all of the house of Israel his associates.’
\verse And join them one to \textit{the} other with respect to you \textit{as} one \textit{piece of} wood, so that they may become one in your hand.
\verse \textit{When} \textit{your people} say to you, \textit{saying}, ‘Will you not inform us \textit{as to} what these \textit{actions} mean for you?’
\verse \textit{Then} speak to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai: “Look!

\verse And the \textit{pieces of} wood \textit{on} which you wrote will be in your hand before their eyes.
\verse And speak to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai: “Look! I \textit{am} taking the \textit{Israelites} from among \textit{the nations to which they went}, and I will gather them from \textit{everywhere}, and I will bring them to their \textit{own} soil.
\verse And I will make them into one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and \textit{they will all have one king as their king}, and they will not again be two nations and will not again divide into two kingdoms again.
\verse And they will not defile themselves again with their idols and with vile idols and with all of their transgressions, and I will save them from all of their apostasy \textit{by which they sinned}, and I will cleanse them and they will be for me as a people and I, I will be for them as God.
\verse “ ‘ “And my servant David \textit{will be} king over them, and one shepherd will be for all of them, and in my regulations they will go, and my statutes they will observe, and they will do them.
\verse And they will dwell on the land that I gave to my servant, to Jacob, \textit{in which your ancestors dwelled}, and they will dwell on it, they and their children and the children of their children \textit{forever}, and my servant David \textit{will be} a leader for them \textit{forever}.
\verse And I will make with them a covenant of peace; \textit{an everlasting covenant} it will be with them. And I will establish them, and I will cause them to increase, and I will put my sanctuary in the midst of them \textit{forever}.
\verse And my tabernacle will be with them, and I will be for them as God, and they will be to me as a nation.

\verse \textit{Above} the doorway and up to the inner temple and on the outside, and on all of the wall \textit{all the way around} in the inner and in the outer \textit{areas} \textit{were} \textit{patterns},
\verse and \textit{it was} made of cherubim and palm tree images; a palm tree image between cherub and cherub, and \textit{the cherub had two faces}.
\verse And \textit{the} face of a human \textit{was toward} the palm tree image \textit{on the one side}, and \textit{the} face of a fierce strong lion \textit{faced} the palm tree image \textit{on the other side}; \textit{this work was executed} for the entire temple \textit{all the way around}.
\verse From the ground up to \textit{above} the doorway, the cherubim and the palm tree images \textit{were} made, and \textit{also} the \textit{outer} wall of the temple.
\verse \textit{As far as} the temple \textit{is concerned} \textit{its} doorframe \textit{was} squared, and \textit{before} the sanctuary \textit{was} the appearance as \textit{it were} the appearance of

\verse \textit{As} to \textit{the} face of \textit{the} length \textit{of the building} \textit{with} the doorway to the north, \textit{it} \textit{was} a hundred cubits, and its width \textit{was} fifty cubits.
\verse Opposite the twenty \textit{cubits} \textit{of the inner courtyard}, and opposite \textit{the} pavement that \textit{was} to the outer courtyard \textit{was} a gallery \textit{facing} a gallery in the three \textit{stories}.
\verse And \textit{in front of} the chambers \textit{was} a passageway ten cubits \textit{in} width toward the inside, a walkway of one cubit, and their doorways \textit{were} to the north.
\verse And the upper chambers narrowed, for \textit{the} galleries took away \textit{space} from them more than \textit{they took} from the lower \textit{levels} and more than \textit{they took} from the middle \textit{level} \textit{in the} building.
\verse For they \textit{were} three stories and \textit{they had no pillars} like the pillars of the courtyards; therefore they were smaller than the lower \textit{stories} and than the middle \textit{stories} from the ground \textit{up}.
\verse And \textit{there was} a wall that was to the outside \textit{alongside} the chambers \textit{on} the walkway to the outer courtyard \textit{in front of} the chambers; its length \textit{was} fifty cubits.
\verse For the length of the chambers which \textit{were} to the outer courtyard \textit{was} fifty cubits, and look! \textit{The chambers} on the front of the temple \textit{were} a hundred cubits.
\verse And from under these chambers \textit{was} the entrance from the east for them \textit{when one enters} from the outer courtyard.
\verse All along the width of the wall of the courtyard \textit{eastward} in front of the courtyard to the front of the building \textit{were} chambers.

\verse and like the doorways of the chambers which \textit{were on} the way of the south \textit{was} \textit{a} doorway at the head of the way \textit{before} the stone wall, projecting \textit{on} the way of the east at their coming.
\verse And he said to me, “The chambers of the north \textit{and} the chambers of the south which \textit{are} \textit{before} the courtyard, they \textit{are the holy chambers} in which the priests, who \textit{are} near to Adonai, will eat the \textit{most holy objects}. There they shall put the \textit{most holy objects}, and the grain offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering, for the place \textit{is} holy.
\verse \textit{When the priests enter}, then they shall not go out from the sanctuary to the outer courtyard; and there they must put their garments in which they serve because they \textit{are} holy. They must put on other garments and \textit{then} they may approach \textit{the area} that \textit{is} for the people.
\verse And he completed the measurements of the inner temple, and he brought me \textit{to} the walkway of the gate \textit{that faces toward the east} and he measured it \textit{all the way around}.
\verse He measured the east side with the reed for measuring, five hundred cubits, with \textit{respect to} reeds with the reed for measurement, \textit{he measured it} all around.
\verse He measured the north side \textit{as} five hundred \textit{cubits}, \textit{with respect to} reeds with the reed for measurement all around.
\verse \textit{Then} he measured the south side \textit{as} five hundred \textit{cubits}, \textit{with respect to} reeds with the reed for measurement.
\verse He went around the west side \textit{and} he measured five hundred \textit{cubits}, \textit{with respect to} reeds with the reed for measurement.
\verse \textit{Toward the four sides} he measured it; \textit{there} \textit{was} a wall for it \textit{all the way around}. \textit{Its} length \textit{was} five hundred \textit{cubits} and \textit{its} width \textit{was} five hundred \textit{cubits}, in order to make \textit{a} separation between what is holy and what is common.

\verse And, look! The glory of the God of Israel, it came from the way of the east, and its sound \textit{was} like \textit{the} sound of many waters and the land radiated due to his glory!
\verse And the appearance of the vision which I saw \textit{was} as the vision which I saw at his coming to destroy the city, and \textit{these} visions \textit{were} \textit{also} as the vision which I saw by the \textit{Kebar River}, and I fell on my face.
\verse And \textit{then} the glory of Adonai came to the temple \textit{by the way of the gate facing east}.
\verse And \textit{the} Spirit lifted me and it brought me to the inner courtyard and, look! The glory of Adonai filled the temple!
\verse And I heard \textit{someone} speaking to me from the house, and a man was standing beside me.
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, \textit{this is} the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet \textit{where I will dwell} in the midst of the \textit{Israelites} to eternity, and they, the house of Israel, they and their kings, will not again defile \textit{my holy name} with their fornication and with their offerings for the dead of their kings \textit{on} their high places.

\verse Now let them send their fornication far away and the offerings for the dead of their kings \textit{away} from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them \textit{forever}.
\verse You, son of man, describe \textit{to} the house of Israel the temple and let them be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the pattern.
\verse And if they are ashamed of all that they did, \textit{then} the plan of the temple and its arrangement and its exits and its entrances and all of its plans and all of its statutes. And all of its plans and all of its laws make known \textit{to} them and write \textit{them} before their eyes, so that they may remember all of its plans and all of its statutes, so that they do them!
\verse This \textit{is} the law of the temple: On the top of the mountain, all of its territory, \textit{all the way around it}, \textit{will be most holy}. Look, this \textit{is} the law of the temple.
\verse And these \textit{are} the measurements of the altar in the cubits (a cubit \textit{is} a cubit and a handbreadth): now its gutter \textit{is a cubit in depth by a cubit in width} and its rim along its edge all around is one span, and this \textit{is} \textit{also} the height of the altar.
\verse And from the gutter at the ground up to the lower ledge \textit{is} two cubits, and \textit{its} width \textit{is} one cubit, and from the small ledge up to the large ledge \textit{is} four cubits, and \textit{its} width \textit{is} one cubit.

And the gutter for it \textit{was} a cubit all around, and its steps \textit{were} facing east.”
\verse And he said to me, “Son of man, thus says the Lord Adonai: ‘These \textit{are} the statutes of the altar on the day \textit{when it is made}, to sacrifice a burnt offering on it and to sprinkle blood on it.
\verse And you must give to the Levitical priests who \textit{are} from the offspring of Zadok, the \textit{ones} \textit{coming} near me,” \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai, “to serve me, a bull, \textit{a calf} as \textit{a} sin offering.
\verse You must take some of its blood and put \textit{it} on \textit{the four horns of the altar}, and the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim all around; thus you must purify it and make atonement for it.
\verse And you must take the bull, the sin offering, and you must burn it in the designated place of the temple outside of the holy place.
\verse And on the second day you must offer a he-goat without defect as \textit{a} sin offering, and they must purify the altar \textit{like} they purified with the bull.
\verse \textit{When you are finished} from purifying, you must offer a bull, \textit{a calf}, without defect, and a ram from the flock without defect.
\verse And you must bring them near \textit{before} Adonai, and the priests must throw salt on them, and they must offer them \textit{as} a burnt offering to Adonai.
\verse \textit{For} seven days you must provide a goat of sin offering for the day and a bull, \textit{a calf}, and a ram from the flock without defect; you must provide \textit{them}.
\verse Seven days they must purify the altar and they must cleanse it and \textit{so} \textit{they will consecrate it}.

\verseWithHeading{The Prince, the Levites, and the Priests Described} And he brought me back \textit{by} the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary that \textit{is} facing east, and it was shut.
\verse And Adonai said to me, “This gate will be shut. It shall not be opened, and \textit{no one} will go through it, for Adonai, the God of Israel, has entered it, and it will be shut.
\verse The prince, he may sit in it to eat food \textit{before} Adonai; he will come from the way of the portico of the gate and by means of its way he will \textit{also} go out.”
\verse Then he brought me \textit{by} the way of the gate of the north to the front of the temple, and I looked, and look! The glory of Adonai filled the temple of Adonai, and I fell on my face.
\verse And Adonai said, “Son of man, set your heart and look with your eyes and with your ears hear \textit{everything} I \textit{am} saying \textit{to} you concerning all the statutes of the temple of Adonai and concerning all its laws, and you must listen \textit{with} your heart concerning the entrance of the temple with all of \textit{the} exits of the sanctuary.
\verse And you must say to \textit{the} rebellious, to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Adonai: “Enough for you, house of Israel, of all of your detestable things!
\verse At your bringing \textit{foreigners} \textit{who are} uncircumcised of heart and uncircumcised of flesh to be in my sanctuary to profane it, my temple, \textit{as you offered my food, fat, and blood}, so you broke my covenant by all of your detestable things.
\verse And you did not observe the responsibility of my sanctuary, but you appointed \textit{them} as the keepers of my responsibility in my sanctuary for you.”
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai: “Every \textit{foreigner} uncircumcised of heart and uncircumcised of flesh shall not come into my sanctuary—\textit{not} any of \textit{the} \textit{foreigners} who \textit{are} in the midst of the \textit{Israelites}.
\verse \textit{But} the Levites who removed themselves from me \textit{at the going astray of Israel}, who went astray from me \textit{and went} after their idols, as a result they will bear their guilt.
\verse Then they will be in my sanctuary, \textit{those} serving \textit{in} my sanctuary, \textit{as} sentries at the gates of the temple and \textit{as} \textit{those} serving the temple; they will slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they will stand \textit{before them} to serve them,
\verse \textit{because} they used to serve them \textit{before} their idols and they were for the house of Israel \textit{like} a stumbling block of iniquity. Therefore \textit{I swore} concerning them,” \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai, “\textit{that} they will bear their iniquity.
\verse And they shall not approach me to serve as \textit{a} priest for me and to come near to all of my holy objects, \textit{to the most holy objects},  and they will bear their disgrace and \textit{the results of} their detestable things they have done.
\verse And I will appoint them \textit{as} the keepers of the responsibility of the temple, for all of its work and \textit{everything} which will be done in it.
\verse But the Levitical priests, the descendants of Zadok, who cared for the responsibility of my sanctuary \textit{when the Israelites went astray} from me, they will approach me to serve me, and they will stand \textit{before me} to offer to me fat and blood,” \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.

\verse Linen turbans shall be on their head and linen undergarments shall be on their waists; they shall not gird themselves with \textit{material causing} perspiration.
\verse When they go out to the outer courtyard to the people, they must take off their garment in which they \textit{were} serving, and they must place them \textit{in the holy chambers}, and they must put on other \textit{garments}, so that they will not make the people holy with their garments.
\verse And their head they shall not shave, or long hair they shall not let grow; short they shall clip their heads.
\verse And no priest shall drink wine when they come into the inner courtyard.
\verse And a widow or divorced \textit{woman} they shall not take for themselves as wives, \textit{but only} a virgin from the offspring of the house of Israel, or the widow who is a widow for a priest they may take.
\verse And they will teach my people \textit{the difference} between what is holy and what is unholy, and \textit{the difference} between unclean and clean they must show them.
\verse And at a legal dispute they themselves shall stand to judge; employing my judgments they shall judge it, and \textit{with respect to} my laws and my statutes. All my festivals they shall keep and my Sabbaths they shall consecrate.
\verse And \textit{near a dead person} he shall not come to be defiled, \textit{but only} for a father and for a mother and for a son and for a daughter, for a brother and for a sister \textit{who was not married} may they defile themselves.
\verse And, after his cleansing, they shall count for him seven days,
\verse and \textit{then} on the day of his coming into the sanctuary to the inner courtyard to serve in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering,” \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.

\verse The grain offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering, they themselves may eat them, and \textit{also} all \textit{the} consecrated possessions in Israel will be theirs.
\verse And \textit{also} what is first of all of \textit{the} firstfruits of everything, and of all of \textit{the} contribution of everything from all of your contributions, to the priest \textit{it belongs}, and what is first of your dough you shall give to the priest, so that a blessing may rest on your house.

\verse In the four corners of the courtyard \textit{were} small courtyards forty \textit{cubits} \textit{in} length and thirty \textit{cubits} \textit{in} width, \textit{each with} \textit{the same measurements} for the four of them with corners.
\verse And a row \textit{was} all around inside them, and cooking-places \textit{were} made under the rows of stones all around.
\verse And he said to me, “These \textit{are} the houses for cooking, where \textit{the ones} serving the temple shall cook the sacrifices of the people.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Ezekiel 47
\verseWithHeading{River of the Temple, Division of the Land and Its Boundaries} And he brought me back to the doorway of the temple and, look! There was water coming out from under the threshold of the temple eastward, because the face of the temple \textit{was} eastwards; and the water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, from south of the altar.
\verse And he brought me out \textit{by the way} of \textit{the} north gate and he led me around \textit{by the} \textit{way leading to the outside of the outer gate} \textit{by} way of the \textit{gate} facing east, and look, there was water trickling from the south side.
\verse As the man went eastward a measuring line \textit{was} in his hand, and he measured a thousand \textit{cubits}. And he led me through \textit{on} into the water; \textit{it was} \textit{ankle deep}.
\verse And he measured a thousand \textit{cubits}, and he brought me over into the waters \textit{and} \textit{it was} \textit{knee deep}. And he measured a thousand \textit{cubits}, and he brought me over \textit{into} the waters \textit{and} \textit{it was} \textit{waist deep}.
\verse And he measured a thousand \textit{cubits}, \textit{and} \textit{it became} a stream that I was not able to cross, because the water rose, \textit{waters a person could swim in}, \textit{and became} a stream that could not be crossed.
\verse And he asked me, “Son of man, did you see \textit{this}?” And he made me go, and he brought me back \textit{along} the bank of the stream.
\verse \textit{When I returned}, then look! On the bank of the river \textit{were} many trees \textit{on both sides}.
\verse And he said to me, “These waters \textit{are} going out to the eastern region, and they go down to the \textit{Jordan Valley}, and they come \textit{to} the sea \textit{and flow} into the sea \textit{where} \textit{they issue out}, and the waters \textit{in the sea} will be healed.
\verse And then every living creature \textit{with} which it teems, \textit{to every place the waters come} it will live; \textit{and} very many fish will live because these waters came there, and \textit{so} the \textit{water} will be healed and everything \textit{will be} alive \textit{everywhere that} \textit{the stream will come}.
\verse And then fishers from En Gedi and \textit{on} up to En Eglaim will stand beside it, a sea-girt drying yard for nets; their fish for the dragnets will be \textit{of every kind}, like the fish of the great sea, \textit{and} very many.
\verse But its marshes and its swamps will not be cured, for they were given for salt.
\verse And along the stream will go up on its banks \textit{from both sides} every tree \textit{producing food}; its leaf will not wither and it will not cease \textit{producing} its fruit. \textit{Every month} it will bear early fruit, for its waters \textit{are} going out from the sanctuary, and its fruit will be as food, and its leaf for healing.”
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai: “This \textit{is} the boundary \textit{by} which you shall distribute the land for \textit{the twelve} tribes of Israel: Two shares \textit{shall be for} Joseph.
\verse And you must take possession of it, each \textit{one} \textit{a share} like his brother, \textit{of this land} which \textit{I swore} to give it to your fathers, and \textit{so} this land shall fall to you as an inheritance.
\verse And this \textit{is} the boundary of the land: \textit{On the north side}, from the great sea \textit{by} the way of Hethlon \textit{until you come to Zedad},
\verse Hamath \textit{to} Berothath \textit{to} Sibraim, which \textit{is} between the boundary of Damascus and the boundary of Hamath, \textit{on to} Hazer Hatticon, which \textit{is} on the boundary of Hauran.
\verse And \textit{so} \textit{the} boundary will be from the sea to Hazar Enan \textit{at} the boundary of Damascus northwards and the boundary of Hamath \textit{to the north}, and this \textit{is the boundary on the} side of \textit{the} north.
\verse \textit{And the eastern boundary} \textit{will be} between Hauran and Damascus, and from between Gilead and the land of Israel \textit{along} the Jordan \textit{River} from \textit{the} boundary on the eastern sea to Tamar. And \textit{this is the border on the east}.
\verse \textit{And on the south side the border} \textit{will run} from Tamar up to the waters \textit{of} Meribot Kadesh \textit{and along} the wadi to the Great Sea. And this \textit{is} \textit{the boundary to the south}.
\verse \textit{And on the west side} the Great Sea \textit{shall be} the boundary up to opposite Lebo-Hamath. \textit{This is the western boundary}.
\verse You shall divide this land for yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
\verse And then you shall allocate it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the aliens dwelling as aliens in the midst of you who have children in the midst of you, and \textit{so} they shall be to you \textit{just} like full citizens among the \textit{Israelites}. With you they shall be allotted with an inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel.
\verse And then in the tribe \textit{in} which an alien who is with you dwells, there you shall give his inheritance,” \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.
