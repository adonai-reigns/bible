\verseWithHeading{Daniel’s Development in the King’s Court} In \textit{the} third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
\verse And the Lord gave Jehoiakim the king of Judah into his hand and \textit{some of} of the utensils of the temple of God, and he brought them \textit{to} the land of Shinar \textit{to} the temple of his gods, and he brought the utensils to \textit{the treasury} of his gods.
\verse And the king \textit{ordered} Ashpenaz, the commander of his court officials, to bring \textit{some of the Israelites} from \textit{the royal family} and from the lords,
\verse youths who \textit{have no physical defect}, and \textit{who are} \textit{handsome}, and \textit{who are} prudent in all wisdom and \textit{endowed with knowledge}, and \textit{who} understand insight, and who \textit{have} the \textit{ability} in them to serve in the palace of the king. \textit{And the king ordered him} to teach them the literature and the language of \textit{the} Chaldeans.
\verse And the king assigned to them \textit{his daily portion} from the fine food of the king, and from \textit{the wine that he drank}, and \textit{instructed that} \textit{they were to be educated for three years}. And at the end \textit{of} their \textit{training}, \textit{they were to be stationed} \textit{before} the king.
\verse Now there was among them \textit{from the Judeans}, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.
\verse And the commander of the court officials gave them names, and he called Daniel, Belteshazzar; and Hananiah, Shadrach; and Mishael, Meshach; and Azariah, Abednego.
\verseWithHeading{Daniel’s Resolve} Now \textit{Daniel resolved} that he would not defile himself with the fine food of the king, and with \textit{the wine that he drank}, and \textit{so} he requested from the commander of the court officials \textit{permission so} that he would not defile himself.
\verse And God gave Daniel favor and compassion \textit{before} the commander of the court officials,
\verse and the commander of the court officials said to Daniel, “I \textit{am} afraid \textit{of} my lord, the king, who has determined your food and your drink, for \textit{why should} he see your face having a worse appearance than the young men who \textit{are your age}? Then you will endanger my head with the king.”
\verse Then Daniel asked the guard whom the commander of the court officials \textit{had} appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
\verse “Please test your servants \textit{for} ten days, and let them give us \textit{some of the vegetables}, and let us eat and let us drink water.
\verse Then let our appearances and the appearance of the young men who are eating the fine food of the king be compared \textit{before you}, and \textit{then} deal with your servants \textit{according to what you see}.”
\verse So he agreed to this proposal with them, and he tested them \textit{for} ten days.
\verse And at the end of ten days their appearances appeared better and \textit{they were} healthier of body than all the young men who were eating the fine food of the king.
\verse \textit{So} the guard \textit{continued to withhold} their fine food and the wine of their drink, and he gave them vegetables.
\verse \textit{And as for these four young men}, God gave to them knowledge and insight into all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had insight into all visions and dreams.
\verse And at the end of the time the king had set to bring them, the commander of the court officials brought them in \textit{before} Nebuchadnezzar.
\verse And the king spoke with them, \textit{and among all of them no one was found like} Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; then they stood \textit{before} the king.
\verse And in every matter of wisdom \textit{and} understanding \textit{about} which the king inquired from them, he found them ten times better \textit{than} all \textit{of} the magicians \textit{and} conjurers that \textit{were in his entire kingdom}.
\verse And Daniel was \textit{there} until the first year of Cyrus the king.

\verseWithHeading{The King’s Troubling Dream} Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him.
\verse So the king said to call the magicians and the conjurers and the sorcerers and the \textit{astrologers} to tell to the king his dreams. And they came in and they stood \textit{before} the king.
\verse And the king said to them, “\textit{I have had a dream} and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.”
\verse And the \textit{astrologers} said to the king \textit{in} Aramaic, “O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants and we will reveal the explanation.”
\verse The king answered and said to the \textit{astrologers}, “The command from me is firm: if you \textit{do} not make known to me the dream and its explanation, \textit{then} you will be broken into pieces and your houses will be laid in ruins.
\verse But if you tell me the dream and its explanation, you will receive gifts and rewards and great honor from me. Therefore, tell me the dream and its explanation.”
\verse They answered once more and said, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants and we will make the explanation known.”
\verse The king answered and said, “\textit{Certainly} I know that \textit{you are trying to gain time} \textit{because} you have seen \textit{that this matter is firmly decreed by me},
\verse for if you \textit{do} not make the dream known to me, \textit{your verdict is fixed}, and you have conspired to say \textit{a} lying and deceitful word to me until the \textit{circumstances} will change. Therefore, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can tell me its explanation.”
\verse The \textit{astrologers} answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth that is able to reveal the word of the king; \textit{in fact}, no great and powerful king has \textit{ever} asked a thing like this of any magician or conjurer or \textit{astrologer}.
\verse And the thing that the king is asking \textit{is too} difficult and \textit{there is no one who} can reveal it to the king except \textit{the} gods \textit{whose dwelling is not with mortals}.”
\verse Because of this the king became angry, and he became very much enraged, and he said \textit{that} all the wise men of Babylon \textit{are} to be destroyed.
\verse And the decree was issued, and the wise men \textit{were on the verge of being executed}, and they searched for Daniel and his companions to be executed.
\verse Then Daniel responded prudently and discretely to Arioch, the commander of the imperial guard of the king, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon.
\verse \textit{He asked} and said to Arioch, the royal official of the king, “\textit{Why} is the decree from the king \textit{so} severe?” Then Arioch explained the matter to Daniel.
\verse And Daniel went in and requested from the king that he would give him time, and \textit{he would tell the king} the explanation.
\verse Then Daniel went to his home, and he made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, his companions,
\verse and \textit{told them} to seek mercy \textit{from the God of heaven} concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions, along with the remainder of the wise men of Babylon, would not be killed.
\verse Then in a vision of the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel; then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
\verse Daniel \textit{said}:
\verse “Let his name, \textit{the name} of God, be blessed \textit{throughout the ages}, 
for the wisdom and the power \textit{are his}.
\verse And he changes the times and the seasons, 
and he deposes kings and he sets up kings; 
he gives wisdom to wise men 
and knowledge to \textit{men who} know understanding.
\verse He reveals the deep and the hidden things; 
he knows what \textit{is} in the darkness, 
and the light dwells with him.
\verseWithHeading{Daniel Praises God and Interprets the King’s Dream} \textit{Therefore} Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and thus he said to him: “You must not destroy the wise men of Babylon; take me in before the king and I will give the explanation to the king.”
\verse Then Arioch \textit{quickly} brought Daniel in before the king and thus he said to him: “I have found a man among \textit{the exiles} of Judah who \textit{can relate} the explanation to the king.
\verse \textit{The king then asked} and said to Daniel, whose name \textit{was} Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its explanation?”
\verse Daniel answered the king and said, “The mystery that the king asks, no wise men, conjurers, magicians, \textit{or} diviners are able to make known to the king.
\verse But there is a God in heaven \textit{who} reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what \textit{it is} that will be at the end of days. This \textit{is} your dream and the visions of your head on your bed.
\verse “\textit{As for you}, king, your thoughts on your bed \textit{turned to} what \textit{it was} that would be \textit{in the future}, and the revealer of mysteries has made known to you what that would be.
\verse And as for me, \textit{it is} not because of wisdom that is in me more than \textit{any other living person} \textit{that} this mystery is revealed to me, but \textit{in order that} the explanation may be made known to the king and you will \textit{understand} the thoughts of your \textit{mind}.
\verse “You, O king, were looking and, look, there was one great statue. This statue \textit{was} huge and its brilliance extraordinary, standing \textit{there} before you, and its appearance \textit{was} frightening.
\verse The head of this statue \textit{was} of fine gold, its chest and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,
\verse its legs of iron, its feet, part of them of iron and part of them of clay.
\verse You were looking on \textit{until} a stone was chiseled out—that not by hands—and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, and it broke them in pieces.
\verse Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold \textit{all at once} broke into pieces and they became like chaff from the summer threshing floor, and the wind carried them away and any trace of them could not be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and it filled the whole earth.
\verse “This \textit{was} the dream, and \textit{now} we will tell its interpretation to the king.
\verse You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power and the might and the glory,
\verse and \textit{also} \textit{human beings wherever they dwell}, the animals of the field and the birds of heaven—he has given into your hand and made you ruler over all of them—you are the head of gold.
\verse And after you another kingdom inferior to yours will arise, and another third \textit{kingdom} of bronze that will rule over the whole earth.
\verse And \textit{a} fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, \textit{and} \textit{just as} iron crushes and smashes \textit{everything}, and as iron shatters all of these \textit{other metals}, \textit{so} it will crush and it will shatter \textit{these nations}.
\verse \textit{And just as} you saw the feet and the toes, \textit{partly potter’s clay} and \textit{partly iron}, it will be a divided kingdom; and \textit{some hardness} of the iron will be \textit{in it}, \textit{just as} you have seen the iron mixed with the wet clay.
\verse And \textit{as} the toes of the feet \textit{were} partly iron and partly clay, \textit{so} part of the kingdom will be strong \textit{and partly brittle}.
\verse And \textit{in} that you saw the iron was mixed with wet clay, \textit{so} \textit{they will mix in marriage} and they will not cling \textit{to one another}, just as iron \textit{does} not mix with clay.
\verse And \textit{in the day of those kings}, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will \textit{never} be destroyed, and the kingdom will not be left for another nation, and it will bring an end to all these kingdoms, but it will stand \textit{forever}.
\verse \textit{Inasmuch as} you saw that a stone from the mountain was chiseled out \textit{but} not by hands, and \textit{that} it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold, \textit{thereby} the great God made known to the king what will be \textit{in the future}, and the dream is certain and its explanation trustworthy.”
\verseWithHeading{The King’s Response to Daniel and His God} Then the king, Nebuchadnezzar, fell on his face and he paid homage to Daniel; and he commanded \textit{them} to offer \textit{a} grain offering and incense offering to him.
\verse The king answered Daniel and said, “\textit{Truly} your God \textit{is} the God of gods and the Lord of kings, and he reveals mysteries, for you are able to reveal this mystery.”
\verse Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and the chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.
\verse And Daniel made a request from the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel \textit{remained} in the court of the king.

\verseWithHeading{The Faithfulness of Three Young Israelites and God’s Deliverance} Nebuchadnezzar the king made a statue of gold. Its height \textit{was} sixty cubits \textit{and} its width \textit{was} six cubits; he set it up in the valley of Dura in the province of Babylon.
\verse Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent \textit{directions} to assemble the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all of the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king \textit{had} set up.
\verse Then the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the province \textit{were} assembled for the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king \textit{had} set up, and \textit{were} standing \textit{before} the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
\verse Then the herald proclaimed \textit{aloud}, “To you \textit{it is commanded}, O peoples, \textit{nations and people of all languages},
\verse \textit{that} at the time that you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, \textit{the} lyre, \textit{the} trigon, \textit{the} harp, \textit{the} drum and all kinds of music, you must fall down and you must worship the statue of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king \textit{has} set up.
\verse And \textit{whoever} does not fall down and worship will be thrown \textit{immediately} into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.”
\verse \textit{Therefore}, \textit{at that time}, \textit{as soon as} all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, the flute, \textit{the} lyre, \textit{the} trigon, \textit{the} harp and all kinds of music, all the peoples, \textit{the nations and people of all languages} \textit{were} falling down \textit{and} were worshiping the statue of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
\verse \textit{Therefore} \textit{at this time} \textit{some} \textit{astrologers} came forward and \textit{they denounced the Jews}.
\verse \textit{They responded and said} to Nebuchadnezzar the king, “O king, may \textit{you} live \textit{forever}!
\verse You, O king, have made a decree that \textit{everyone} who hears the sound of the horn, the flute, \textit{the} lyre, \textit{the} trigon, \textit{the} harp and \textit{the} drum and all kinds of music, he shall fall down and shall worship the statue of gold.
\verse \textit{And whoever} \textit{does not fall down} and worship shall be thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.
\verse \textit{However} there are Judean men whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—these men, O king, \textit{pay you no heed} \textit{and} \textit{were} not serving your god, and the statue of gold that you set up they are not worshiping.”
\verse Then Nebuchadnezzar said in rage and anger to bring in Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego; then they brought in these men before the king.
\verse Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, “\textit{Is it} true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, \textit{that} you are not serving my god, and \textit{you are} not worshiping the statue of gold that I have set up?
\verse Now if you are ready so that \textit{when} you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, \textit{the} trigon, \textit{the} harp and \textit{the} drum and all kinds of music, you fall down and you worship the statue that I have made, \textit{that will be good}. But if you do not worship it, \textit{immediately} you will be thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire, and \textit{who is the god} who will rescue you from my hands?”
\verse Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king, Nebuchadnezzar, “We have no need on this matter \textit{to present a defense to you}.
\verse \textit{If it is so}, our God, whom we serve, is able to rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire. And from your hand, O king, let him rescue us.
\verse And if not, let it be known to you, O king, that \textit{we will not serve your gods}, and the statue of gold that you have set up we will not worship.”
\verseWithHeading{The Wrath of the King and His Fiery Furnace of Death} Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with anger and the image of his face was changed \textit{toward} Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, \textit{so he} \textit{ordered and said} to heat up the one furnace seven times what was usual to heat \textit{it} up.
\verse And he commanded \textit{the strongest men of the guards} who \textit{were} in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and to throw \textit{them} into the furnace of blazing fire.
\verse Then these men were bound with their garments, their trousers and their turbans and their \textit{other} clothing, and they were thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.
\verse \textit{Therefore} \textit{because} the word of the king was severe and the furnace was exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed these men who lifted up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.
\verse But these men, the three of them, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, fell down into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire, \textit{and they} were bound.
\verse Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and he rose up in haste \textit{and} he asked, saying to his advisers, “\textit{Did} we not throw three men, bound, into the midst of the fire? They answered, saying to the king, “Certainly, O king!”
\verse \textit{He answered}, saying, “Look, I see four men unbound walking in the midst of the fire and there is no damage to them, and the appearance of the fourth \textit{man} resembles the son of a god.”
\verse Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire, \textit{and} he called out, saying, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, \textit{servants} of the Most High God, come out and come here!”
\verse And the satraps, the prefects, the governors and the advisors of the king \textit{were} assembling, \textit{and} they saw these men, that the fire had no power over their bodies, and the hair of their heads was not singed, and their garments were not harmed, and the smell of fire did not come from them.
\verseWithHeading{The King’s Praise for the Great Deliverance of the Three Young Israelites} Nebuchadnezzar \textit{responded}, saying, “Blessed be their God, \textit{the God} of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who sent his angel and rescued his servants who trusted in him, and the command of the king they disobeyed, and they gave their bodies so that they \textit{did} not serve and \textit{did} not worship any god except their God.
\verse And from me \textit{is set forth} a decree that any people, nation, or language that \textit{may} utter criticism against their God—\textit{the God of} Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego—will be broken into pieces and their house will be made like ruins. \textit{For} there is not another God who is able to rescue like this \textit{God}.”
\verse Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.

\verse It is pleasing to me to recount the signs and wonders that the Most High God worked for me.
\verse How great \textit{are} his signs and wonders, how strong \textit{is} his kingdom, \textit{an everlasting kingdom}; and his sovereignty is from generation to generation.
\verseWithHeading{The Dream and the King’s Search for an Interpreter} “I, Nebuchadnezzar, was content in my house and prospering in my palace.
\verse And I saw a dream and a revelation on my bed and it frightened me, and the visions of my head terrified me.
\verse And a decree was \textit{sent out}, \textit{ordering that} all \textit{the} wise men of Babylon \textit{were} to be brought in before me \textit{so} that they may make known to me \textit{the} explanation of the dream.
\verse Then the magicians, the conjurers, the \textit{astrologers} and the diviners came in and I told them the dream, but they could not make known to me its explanation.
\verse Then \textit{at last} Daniel came before me \textit{whose name was} Belteshazzar, \textit{according to} the name of my god, \textit{and} \textit{in whom was the spirit of the holy gods}, \textit{and I related the dream to him}.
\verse “ ‘\textit{O} Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I myself know that \textit{the} spirit of \textit{the} holy gods \textit{is} in you, and \textit{no mystery is too difficult} for you. \textit{Now} tell \textit{me} \textit{the} visions of my dream that I saw, and its explanation.
\verse Now \textit{these were} the visions of my head \textit{as I was lying} on my bed: I was \textit{gazing} and, look, a tree \textit{was} in the midst of the earth, and its height \textit{was} exalted.
\verse The tree grew and it became strong, 
and its height reached to heaven, 
and \textit{it was visible to the end of the whole earth}.
\verse Its foliage \textit{was} beautiful, 
and its fruit abundant, 
and in it \textit{was} provision for all. 
Under it the animals of the field sought shade, 
and in its branches the birds of heaven nested, 
and from it all the living beings were fed.
\verse “ ‘I was looking in the vision of my head \textit{as I lay} on my bed, and look, a watcher, and \textit{a} holy \textit{one}, came down from heaven.
\verse He cried \textit{aloud} and so he said:
\verse “Cut down the tree and chop off its branches; 
shake off its foliage and scatter its fruit. 
Let the animals flee from under it, 
and the birds from its branches.
\verse But the stump of its roots 
leave in the earth, 
\textit{along with} a band of iron and bronze; 
\textit{leave it} in the grass of the field. 
And in the dew of heaven 
let it be watered, 
and with the animals 
let his lot \textit{be} in \textit{the} grass of the earth.
\verse Let his mind be changed from \textit{that of a} human,

and let seven times pass over him.
\verse “ ‘This \textit{is} the dream \textit{that} I, Nebuchadnezzar the king, saw. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare its explanation, \textit{for} all of \textit{the} wise men of my kingdom were not able to make the explanation known to me, but you are able because \textit{the} spirit of holy gods \textit{is} in you.’
\verseWithHeading{Daniel Relates and Interprets the Dream} “Then Daniel, whose name \textit{was} Belteshazzar, was distressed \textit{for some time}, and his thoughts disturbed him.

\verse \textit{And in that} they said to leave alone the stump of the tree’s root, so your kingdom \textit{will be} restored for you \textit{when} you acknowledge that heaven \textit{is} sovereign.

\verseWithHeading{God Judges the King for His Hubris} \textit{All this happened} to Nebuchadnezzar the king.
\verse At the end of twelve months he was walking on the \textit{roof of} \textit{the royal palace} of Babylon.
\verse And the king answered and said, “Is this not the great Babylon which I have built as a royal palace by the strength of my own power, and for the glory of my own majesty?”
\verse \textit{While} the words \textit{were} still in the mouth of the king, a voice from heaven came, \textit{saying}, ‘To you, King Nebuchadnezzar, \textit{it} is declared that the kingdom has departed from you,
\verse and you will be driven away from \textit{human society} and your dwelling \textit{will be} with the animals of the field and they will cause you to graze \textit{the} grass like oxen, and seven times will pass over you, until you acknowledge that the Most High \textit{is} sovereign over the kingdom of humankind and that he gives it to whom he wills.’
\verse \textit{Immediately} the word was fulfilled \textit{concerning} Nebuchadnezzar, and he was expelled from \textit{human society} and he ate grass like oxen, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven until his hair \textit{was} like \textit{the hair of} an eagle and his nails grew like \textit{a} bird’s \textit{claws}.
\verseWithHeading{The King Praises and Extols the Most High God} “But at the end of \textit{that period}, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and \textit{then} my reason returned to me; and I blessed the Most High and \textit{the one who lives forever} I praised and I honored.
\verse “For his sovereignty \textit{is} \textit{an} everlasting sovereignty,

\verse “\textit{At that time} my reason returned to me, and \textit{also} the glory of my kingdom and my majesty and splendor returned to me, and my advisers and my lords searched \textit{me} out, and I was established over my kingdom and abundant greatness was added to me.
\verse Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor the king of heaven, for all his works \textit{are} truth, and his ways \textit{are} justice and that he is able to humble those who walk in pride.”

\verseWithHeading{The Mysterious Writing on the Wall} Belshazzar the king made a great festival for \textit{a} thousand \textit{of} his lords, and \textit{in the presence of} the thousand \textit{lords} he was drinking wine.
\verse \textit{When he tasted the wine}, Belshazzar commanded \textit{that they} bring \textit{the} vessels of gold and silver that Nebuchadnezzar his \textit{predecessor} had taken from the temple that \textit{was} in Jerusalem, so that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines may drink from them.
\verse Then they brought in the vessels of gold that they took from the temple, the house of God that \textit{was} in Jerusalem, and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines drank from them.
\verse They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood and stone.
\verse \textit{Immediately} \textit{human fingers} appeared and they wrote \textit{opposite} the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the palace of the king, and the king was watching the palm of the hand that was writing.

\verse Because of the words of the king and his lords, the queen came into \textit{the banqueting hall} and the queen \textit{spoke up} and said, “O king, live \textit{forever}, and let not your thoughts terrify you and \textit{do} not let your facial expressions \textit{grow pale}.
\verse There is a man in your kingdom \textit{who has the spirit of the holy gods in him}. And in the days of your \textit{predecessor}, enlightenment and insight and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods was found in him; and, O king, Nebuchadnezzar your \textit{predecessor} appointed him \textit{as} chief of the magicians, the conjurers, the \textit{astrologers}, \textit{and} the diviners. Your \textit{predecessor} the king \textit{did this}
\verse \textit{because} \textit{there} was found in him \textit{an} excellent spirit and understanding and insight \textit{for} interpreting dreams and explaining riddles and solving riddles; \textit{that is}, in Daniel \textit{whom the king named} Belteshazzar. Now, let Daniel be called and he will tell the explanation.”
\verseWithHeading{Daniel Deciphers and Interprets the Writing} Then Daniel was brought in before the king, \textit{and} the king \textit{spoke} and said to Daniel, “You \textit{are} Daniel \textit{who are one of the exiles} of Judah whom my \textit{predecessor}, the king, brought from Judah.
\verse And I have heard that a spirit of the gods \textit{is} in you and enlightenment and insight and excellent wisdom was found in you.
\verse And now the wise men \textit{and} the conjurers were brought in before me \textit{so} that they could read this writing \textit{in order to} make its explanation known to me, but they were not able to disclose the explanation of the matter.
\verse But I have heard concerning you that you are able \textit{to produce interpretations} and to solve riddles; now if you are able to read the writing and to make known its explanation to me, you will be clothed \textit{in} purple and \textit{a} necklace of gold \textit{will be placed} around your neck and you will rule \textit{as} third \textit{in command} in the kingdom.”
\verse Then Daniel answered and said before the king, “Let your gifts be for yourself or your rewards give to another; nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and I will make known to him the explanation.
\verse \textit{O king}, the Most High God gave the kingdom and the greatness and the glory and the majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your \textit{predecessor}.
\verse And because of the greatness that he gave to him, all the peoples, the nations and languages trembled and feared before him; whomever he wanted he killed, and whomever he wanted he let live, and whomever he wanted he honored, and whomever he wanted he humbled.
\verse But \textit{when} his heart became arrogant and his spirit became hard \textit{so as} to act proudly, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom and the glory \textit{was taken away from him}.
\verse And he was driven away \textit{from human society} and his mind was made like the animals and his dwelling \textit{was} with the wild asses; \textit{and} \textit{he was given} grass like oxen to eat, and with the dew of heaven his body was bathed, until he acknowledged that the Most High God \textit{is} sovereign over the kingdom of humankind, and \textit{whoever} he wants he sets over it.
\verse “But you his \textit{successor}, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart \textit{even though} you knew all this.
\verse And \textit{now} you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven, and the vessels of his temple you have brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines, have been drinking wine from them, and you have praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone that \textit{do} not see and \textit{do} not hear and \textit{do} not know, but the God \textit{who holds your life in his hand} and all of your ways \textit{come from him}, you have not honored.
\verse So then the palm of the hand was sent out from his presence and this writing was inscribed.
\verse “Now this was the writing that was inscribed: ‘Mene, Mene, Tekel and Parsin.’
\verse “This \textit{is} the explanation of the matter: ‘Mene’—God has numbered your kingdom and brought an end \textit{to} it.
\verse “ ‘Tekel’—you have been weighed on scales and you have been found wanting.
\verse “ ‘Peres’—your kingdom has been divided and given to \textit{the} Medes and Persians.’ ”
\verse Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel \textit{with} purple and \textit{placed} a necklace of gold around his neck, and they made a proclamation concerning him that he would be \textit{the} third ruler \textit{in authority} in the kingdom.
\verse \textit{That same night} Belshazzar, the Chaldean king, was killed.
\verse  And Darius the Mede received the kingdom \textit{when he was about sixty-two years old}.

\verseWithHeading{Daniel’s Integrity and His Entrapment by His Enemies} \textit{It pleased Darius}, and he set up one hundred and twenty satraps over the kingdom, that they were \textit{throughout the whole kingdom},
\verse and over them \textit{were} three administrators, \textit{of} whom Daniel \textit{was} one, \textit{so} that these satraps were giving account to them, and the king would not be suffering loss.
\verse Then Daniel \textit{began distinguishing himself} above the administrators and the satraps \textit{because} an exceptional spirit \textit{was} in him, and \textit{so} the king planned to appoint him over the whole kingdom.
\verse Then the \textit{other} administrators and satraps \textit{began to seek} to find \textit{a} pretext against Daniel \textit{in connection with the kingdom}, but they were not able to find any pretext and \textit{corruption} \textit{because} he was trustworthy, and no negligence or \textit{corruption} \textit{could be found in him}.
\verse Then these men \textit{said}, “We will not find any pretext against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.”
\verse So the administrators and the satraps conspired \textit{with respect to} the king and so they said to him, “Darius, O king, live \textit{forever}!
\verse All of \textit{the} administrators of the kingdom, and the prefects, the satraps, the counselors and the governors took counsel \textit{and have} agreed to establish an edict of the king and to enforce a decree that \textit{whoever} will seek a prayer from any god or human except from you \textit{for} up to thirty days will be thrown into \textit{the lion pit}.
\verse Now, O king, establish the edict and you must sign the document \textit{so} that \textit{it} cannot be changed, according to \textit{the} law of \textit{the} Medes and Persians which cannot be revoked.”
\verse \textit{So} the king, Darius, signed the writing and the interdict.
\verse Now \textit{when} Daniel realized that the document was signed, he went to his house (\textit{now he had windows in his upper room that were open} toward Jerusalem), and three times \textit{daily} he knelt on his knees and prayed and \textit{gave} praise before his God, \textit{just as} he had been doing \textit{previously}.
\verse Then these men came as a group and they found Daniel praying and pleading for mercy before his God.
\verse Then they approached \textit{and spoke with the king} concerning the edict of the king, “\textit{Did you not sign an edict} that any person who would seek \textit{anything} from any God or human within thirty days except from you, O king, would be thrown into \textit{the lion pit}?” The king answered and said, “The matter \textit{as you have just stated} is certain according to \textit{the} law of \textit{the} Medes and Persians which cannot be revoked.”
\verseWithHeading{God’s Miraculous Deliverance of Daniel Again} Then \textit{they responded} and said before the king, “Daniel, who \textit{is} from \textit{the exiles} of Judah, \textit{is not paying any attention} to you, O king, or to the decree that you have signed, \textit{and three times daily} he says his prayer.”
\verse Then the king, when he heard that \textit{report}, he was extremely distressed over it; and \textit{concerning Daniel} \textit{he was determined} to rescue him. And until the setting of the sun he was making every effort to deliver him.
\verse Then these men came as \textit{a} group to the king and \textit{said}, “Recall, O king, that \textit{with respect to} \textit{the} law of \textit{the} Medes and Persians that \textit{any} decree or edict that the king establishes cannot be changed.”
\verse Then the king gave the command, and Daniel was brought in and they threw \textit{him} into \textit{the lion pit}. \textit{The king said} to Daniel, “Your God, whom you serve \textit{faithfully}, may he rescue you!”
\verse And a stone was brought and it was put on the entrance of the pit, and the king sealed it with his signet \textit{ring} and with the signet \textit{rings} of his lords, so that nothing would be changed concerning Daniel.
\verse Then the king went to his palace and spent the night in fasting, and no food was brought in before him and his sleep fled from him.
\verse Then the king got up at daybreak, at first light, and he went \textit{in haste} to \textit{the lion pit}.
\verse And \textit{when he came near} to the pit, he cried out to Daniel with \textit{a} distressed voice, \textit{and} the king \textit{spoke} and said to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, your God whom you serve faithfully, was he able to rescue you from the lions?”
\verse Then Daniel spoke to the king, “O king, live \textit{forever}!
\verse My God sent his angel and he shut the mouth of the lions and they did not hurt me, \textit{because} before him \textit{I was found} blameless, and also before you, O king, I have not done \textit{any} wrong.”
\verse Then the king was exceedingly glad over it and commanded \textit{that} Daniel be lifted up from the pit; and \textit{there} was not any wound found on him, because he had trusted in his God.
\verse The king then commanded, and these men were brought \textit{who had accused Daniel}, and they threw them and their children and their wives into \textit{the lion pit}, and they had not reached the floor of the pit \textit{before} the lions had overpowered them and they had crushed all of their bones.
\verseWithHeading{The King Praises the God of Daniel and Daniel Prospers} Then Darius the king wrote to all the people, the nations, and the languages living in the whole earth, “May your prosperity become great!

\verseWithHeading{Daniel’s Vision of Four Beasts and the Son of Man} In the first year of Belshazzar the king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head \textit{as he lay} on his bed; then he wrote down the dream \textit{and} \textit{the} \textit{summary} of \textit{the} words \textit{as follows}:
\verse Daniel \textit{explained} and said, “I was looking in my vision in the night, and look, the four winds of heaven were stirring \textit{up} the great sea.
\verse And four great beasts \textit{were} coming up from the sea, differing \textit{from one another}.
\verse The first \textit{was} like \textit{a} lion and \textit{had} \textit{the} wings of an eagle. I was watching until its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the earth and it was raised on \textit{its} feet like a human, and a human heart was given to it.
\verse And look, another beast, a second one, looking like a bear. And it was raised up on one side and three tusks \textit{were} in its mouth between its teeth, and so \textit{it was told}, “Arise, eat much flesh!”
\verse After this I was watching and look, another \textit{beast} like a leopard; \textit{it had four wings} of a bird on its back, and \textit{the beast had} four heads, and dominion was given to it.
\verse After this in the visions of the night I was looking and there was a fourth beast, terrifying and frightful and exceedingly strong, and \textit{it had} \textit{great iron teeth}, \textit{and it was} devouring and crushing, and it stamped the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all \textit{the other} beasts \textit{that preceded it} \textit{and it had ten horns}.
\verse I was considering the horns, and look, another little horn came up \textit{among} them, and three of the earlier horns \textit{were rooted out} from before it, and there were eyes like the eyes of \textit{a} human in this horn and \textit{also} a mouth \textit{that was} speaking boastfully.
\verse “\textit{I continued watching} until thrones were placed and an Ancient of Days sat; his clothing \textit{was} like white snow and the hair of his head \textit{was} like pure wool and his throne \textit{was} a flame of fire and its wheels \textit{were} burning fire.
\verse A stream of fire issued forth and flowed \textit{from his presence}; thousands \textit{upon} thousands served him and ten thousand \textit{upon} ten thousand stood before him. The judge sat, and \textit{the} books were opened.
\verse “\textit{I continued watching} then because of the noise of the boastful words of the horn \textit{who was} speaking; \textit{I continued watching} until the beast was slain and its body was destroyed, and it was given \textit{over} to burning with fire.
\verse And \textit{as for} the remainder of the beasts, \textit{their dominion was taken away}, but a prolongation \textit{of their life} was given to them for a season and a time.
\verse “\textit{I continued watching} in the visions of the night, and look, with the clouds of heaven \textit{one} like a son of man was coming, and he came to the Ancient of Days, and \textit{was presented} before him.
\verse And to him was given dominion and glory and kingship that all the peoples, the nations, and languages \textit{would} serve him; his dominion \textit{is} a dominion \textit{without end} that will not cease, and his kingdom \textit{is one} that will not be destroyed.
\verseWithHeading{Daniel Explains and Interprets the Vision} “\textit{As for me, Daniel}, my spirit was troubled \textit{within me}, and the visions of my head terrified me.
\verse \textit{So} I approached one of the attendants and I asked him \textit{about} the truth concerning all this; and he told me \textit{that} he would make known to me the explanation of the matter.
\verse ‘These great beasts which are four \textit{in number} \textit{are} four kings \textit{who} will arise from the earth.
\verse But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom, and they will take possession of the kingdom forever, \textit{forever and ever}.’
\verse “Then I desired to make certain concerning the fourth beast that was different from \textit{all the others}—exceedingly terrifying, with its iron teeth and its claws of bronze; it devoured and crushed \textit{and} stamped the remainder with its feet—
\verse and concerning the horns that \textit{were} on its head, and \textit{concerning} \textit{the} other \textit{horn} that came up and \textit{before which three horns fell}, and this horn \textit{had eyes} and \textit{a} mouth speaking \textit{boastfully}, and its appearance \textit{was} larger than its companions.
\verse \textit{I continued watching}, and this horn made war with \textit{the} holy ones and it prevailed over them,
\verse until the Ancient of Days came and gave judgment to \textit{the} holy ones of \textit{the} Most High; and the time arrived and \textit{the} holy ones took possession of the kingdom.
\verse “And he said, ‘The fourth beast \textit{is} the fourth kingdom \textit{that} will be on the earth that will be different from all the \textit{other} kingdoms, and it will devour the whole earth and it will trample it and it will crush it.
\verse And \textit{as for} the ten horns \textit{coming} from it, \textit{from} this kingdom ten kings will arise, and another will arise after them. And he will be different from the earlier \textit{ones}, and he will subdue three kings.
\verse And he will speak words against the Most High, and he will wear out \textit{the} holy ones of the Most High, and he will attempt to change times and law, and they will be given into his hand for a time and two times and half a time.
\verse Then the court will sit, and his dominion will be removed, to be eradicated and to be destroyed \textit{totally}.
\verse And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to \textit{the} nation of \textit{the} holy ones of the Most High; his kingdom \textit{is an everlasting kingdom}, and all the dominions will serve and obey him.’
\verse \textit{This is the end of the account}. \textit{As for me, Daniel}—my thoughts terrified me greatly and my face changed over me, but I kept the matter in my heart.”

\verseWithHeading{The Vision of a Small Horn that Oppresses Israel and Threatens the Temple} In the third year \textit{of} the kingdom of Belshazzar the king, a vision appeared \textit{to me, Daniel}, after the one that appeared to me \textit{previously}.
\verse And I saw in the vision, \textit{and when I saw}, I \textit{was} in Susa, the citadel that \textit{was} in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and \textit{I myself} was at the stream of Ulai.
\verse And I lifted up my eyes and I saw, and look! A ram standing \textit{before} the stream, and \textit{it had} two horns, and the horns \textit{were} long, but the one \textit{was} longer than the second, and the longer \textit{one} came up \textit{after the other one}.
\verse I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward, and \textit{none of the beasts stood before it}, and there was no rescuing from \textit{its power}, and it did \textit{what it wanted} and it became strong.
\verse And I was considering \textit{this}, and look, a he-goat coming from the west across the face of the whole earth, and \textit{it} was not touching the ground; and the he-goat \textit{had} \textit{a conspicuous horn} between its eyes.
\verse Then it came toward the ram \textit{that had the two horns} that I saw standing \textit{before} the stream, and it ran at it with the rage of its power.
\verse And I saw it approaching the ram and it was furious at it, and it struck the ram, and it broke its two horns, and \textit{there was not strength in the ram to stand before him}, and he threw it down to the ground and trampled it, \textit{and there was no one who could rescue the ram} from its power.
\verse And the he-goat grew \textit{exceedingly great}, and \textit{at the height of its power} the great horn was broken, and four conspicuous horns came up in place of it toward the four winds of heaven.
\verse \textit{And from one of them} came forth \textit{a} horn, \textit{a little one}, and it grew exceedingly toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beautiful land.
\verse And it grew up to the host of heaven, and it threw down to the ground some of the host and some of the stars and trampled them.
\verse Even against the prince of the hosts it acted arrogantly and took away from him the regular burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown.
\verse And on account of transgression, \textit{the} host was given over \textit{to the horn} in addition to the regular burnt offering. And it cast down truth to the ground, and it \textit{acted}, and it had success.
\verse And I heard a certain holy one speaking, and a certain other holy one said to the specific one \textit{who was speaking}, “\textit{For how long} \textit{is} the vision \textit{concerning} the regular burnt offering, and the transgression \textit{that} makes desolate, and \textit{the} giving over \textit{of the} sanctuary and \textit{the} host to trampling?”

\verse And he came beside \textit{where I was standing}, and \textit{when he came} I became terrified and I fell prostrate on my face. And he said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the vision \textit{is} for \textit{the} time of \textit{the} end.”
\verse And \textit{when he spoke} with me I fell into a trance with my face to the ground, and he touched me and made me stand on by feet.

\verse And I myself, Daniel, alone saw this great vision, and \textit{as a result} \textit{no strength was left in me} and \textit{my complexion grew deathly pale}, and I did not retain any strength.
\verse And I heard the sound of his words, and \textit{when I heard} the sound of his words I myself \textit{began} falling into a trance on my face, \textit{with my face to the ground}.
\verse And look, a hand touched me and it roused me to my knees and the palms of my hands.
\verse And he said to me, “Daniel, \textit{a} man beloved, pay attention to the words that I \textit{am} speaking to you and \textit{stand upright where you are}, for I have now been sent to you.” And \textit{while he was speaking} with me this word, I stood up trembling.
\verse And he said to me, “You must not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and to humble yourself \textit{before} your God, your words were heard, and I \textit{myself} have come because of your words.
\verse But \textit{the} prince of \textit{the} kingdom of Persia stood \textit{before me} \textit{for} twenty-one days. And look, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to assist me, and I left \textit{him} there beside \textit{the} king of \textit{the} Persians.
\verse And I have come to instruct you about what will happen to your people \textit{in the future}, for \textit{there is} a further vision \textit{here} \textit{for the future}.
\verse And while he was speaking with me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and I was speechless.
\verse Then look, there was \textit{one in the form of a human}; he touched my lips and I opened my mouth and I spoke and I said to the \textit{one} standing \textit{before me}, “My lord, because of the vision my anxieties fell upon me and I \textit{have} not retained \textit{my} strength.
\verse So \textit{how am I, a servant of my lord} to speak with \textit{you, my lord}, and I \textit{just now} \textit{have no strength in me}?”
\verse And \textit{he again touched} me, \textit{the one in the form of a human}, and he strengthened me.
\verse And he said, “You must not fear, \textit{O} beloved man. \textit{Peace be to you}; be strong and be courageous!” And \textit{when he spoke} with me, I was strengthened and I said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”
\verse Then he asked, “Do you know why I have come to you? And now I return to fight against the prince of Persia and I \textit{myself} \textit{am} going, and look, \textit{the} prince of Javan will come.
\verse However, I will tell you \textit{what is inscribed} in \textit{the} book of truth, and there is not one \textit{who} contends with me against these \textit{beings} \textit{except} Michael, your prince.”

\verseWithHeading{A Survey of the Kings of the North and South} “And I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, \textit{I stood} as a support and as a protection for him.
\verse And now I will reveal \textit{the} truth to you. Look! Still three kings will arise in Persia, and the fourth will get abundance \textit{and} great wealth, \textit{even} more than all \textit{of them}, and \textit{when he becomes strong} through his wealth, \textit{then} he will stir up \textit{everyone} against \textit{the} kingdom of Javan.
\verse And a mighty king will arise, and he will rule \textit{with} great dominion, and he will do \textit{as he pleases}.
\verse But \textit{as he rises in power}, his kingdom will be divided toward the four winds of heaven, but not to his posterity, and not according to his dominion \textit{by} which he ruled, for his kingdom will be uprooted and \textit{be given} \textit{to others besides them}.
\verse “Then the king of the south will grow strong and \textit{also} \textit{one of his officials}, and he will grow stronger \textit{than him} and he will rule \textit{a dominion greater than his dominion}.
\verse And at \textit{the} end of \textit{some} years they will make an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make a peace treaty, but \textit{she will not retain her position of power}, and his offspring will not endure, and she will be given up, she and her attendants and her child supporting her, in those times.
\verse And a branch from her roots will rise up \textit{in} his place, and he will come against the army and he will enter the stronghold of the king of the north and he will take action against them and he will prevail.
\verse And also their gods with their idols \textit{and} with the \textit{precious vessels}, silver and gold he will take to Egypt into captivity, and \textit{for} years \textit{he will leave the king of the north alone}.
\verse And \textit{then} he will come into the kingdom of the king of the south, but he will return to his land.
\verse “But his sons will wage war and they will gather a multitude of great forces and \textit{he will advance with great force}, and he will overflow \textit{like a flood} and he will pass through and he will return, and they will wage war up to his fortress.
\verse And the king of the south will become furious, and he will go and he will battle against him, against the king of the north; and he will muster a great multitude, and the multitude will be given into his hand.
\verse When the multitude is carried off, his heart will be exalted and he will overthrow \textit{tens of thousands}, but he will not prevail.
\verse And the king of the north will again raise a multitude, greater than the former, and \textit{at the end of some years} he will surely come with \textit{a} great army and with great supplies.
\verse “And in these times many will rise \textit{up} against the king of the south, and \textit{the violent ones of your people} will lift themselves \textit{to fulfill} \textit{the} vision, but they will fall.
\verse And the king of the north will come, and he will throw up siege ramps and capture a city of fortifications and the military forces of the south and \textit{his choice troops} will not stand, for there is no strength \textit{left} to resist.
\verse And the \textit{one} coming to him will act \textit{according to} his pleasure, and there is no \textit{one who} \textit{will stand} \textit{before him}, and he will stand in \textit{the beautiful land} and complete destruction \textit{will be} in his power.
\verse And he will set his face to come with the authority of his whole kingdom and will form an agreement; and he will \textit{act}, and the daughter of women he will give to him to destroy it, but \textit{the ploy} will not succeed \textit{and she will not support him}.
\verse And he will turn his face to \textit{the} coastlands, and he will capture many, but a commander will end his insults to him \textit{so that instead his insults will turn back upon him}.
\verse And he will turn back his face toward the strongholds of his land, but he will stumble and he will fall and will not be found.
\verse “Then in his place will arise \textit{one} sending an official \textit{throughout} \textit{the} glory of \textit{his} kingdom, and \textit{in a few days} he will be broken, but not in anger and not in battle.
\verse And in his place a despicable person will arise on whom they have not conferred the majesty of \textit{the} kingdom, and he will come in \textit{without warning} and he will seize \textit{the} kingdom by deceit.
\verse And \textit{before him} \textit{mighty military forces} will be utterly swept away, and they will be broken, and also \textit{the} leader of \textit{the} covenant.
\verse And after an alliance \textit{is made} with him, he will act deceitfully, and he will rise and he will become powerful with few people \textit{backing him}.
\verse In \textit{a time of} ease and in \textit{the} rich parts of \textit{the} province, he will come and he will do what \textit{his predecessors} did not do; he will distribute plunder and spoil and possessions to them, and he will devise his plans against fortifications, but \textit{only} \textit{for a time}.
\verse And he will stir up his power and his heart against the king of the south and \textit{with a much greater and stronger army}; but he will not succeed, for they will devise plans against him.
\verse And those who eat of his royal rations will break him and his army will be overwhelmed, and many will fall, slain.
\verse \textit{And two of the kings} \textit{will bend their hearts} to evil. And at the \textit{same table} they will speak lies, but \textit{what is discussed} will not succeed, for still an end \textit{is coming} at the appointed time.
\verse Then he will return to his land with many possessions, but his heart \textit{will be set} against \textit{the holy covenant}, and he will take action and he will return to his land.
\verse “At the appointed time he will return and he will come into the south, but it will not be \textit{as it was before}.
\verse And \textit{the} ships of Kittim will come against him, and he will lose heart, and he will turn back, and he will be enraged \textit{against the holy covenant}, and he will take action, and he will turn back, and he will pay attention to \textit{those who} forsake \textit{the holy covenant}.
\verse And military forces from him \textit{will occupy} and will profane the \textit{sanctuary stronghold}, and they will abolish the regular burnt offering, and they will set up the abomination that causes desolation.
\verse “And those who violate \textit{the} covenant he will seduce with flattery, but the persons who know their God will stand firm and will take action.
\verse And those who have insight \textit{will instruct} the many, but they will fall by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder \textit{for some time}.
\verse And \textit{when they fall} they will receive little help, and many will join with them \textit{in} hypocrisy.
\verse And \textit{even} some of those \textit{who have insight}﻿ will fall \textit{in order for} them to be refined by it, and to be purified and cleansed until the time of \textit{the} end, for the appointed time \textit{is} still to come.
\verse “Then the king will do \textit{as he pleases}, and he will exalt himself and will consider himself above any god, and he will speak horrendous things \textit{against} \textit{the} God of gods, yet he will succeed until \textit{the period} of anger is finished, for \textit{what} is determined will be done.
\verse He will not pay respect to the gods of his ancestors, or to \textit{the} darling of women, and not to any god will he pay respect, for he will consider himself great over all \textit{gods}.
\verse But \textit{instead} he will honor the god of fortresses, a god whom his ancestors did not know. He will honor \textit{him} with gold, and with silver, and with precious stones and with costly gifts.
\verse And he will deal with \textit{the} \textit{fortified strongholds} with \textit{the help of} \textit{a foreign god}; and he will increase wealth for whoever will acknowledge \textit{him}, and he will cause them to rule over the many, and he will distribute land for a price.
\verse “And at \textit{the} time of \textit{the} end the king of the south will attack him, and the king of the north will storm against him with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships, and he will advance against the countries and \textit{he will sweep through like a flood}.
\verse And he will come \textit{into the beautiful land} and many will fall victim, but these will escape from his power: Edom and Moab and the best part of the \textit{Ammonites}.
\verse And he will stretch out his hand against countries and the land of Egypt \textit{will not escape}.
\verse And he will rule over the treasures of gold and the silver and over all the precious things of Egypt; and \textit{the} Libyans and \textit{the} Cushites \textit{will follow} in his footsteps.
\verse But reports will terrify him from \textit{the} east and from \textit{the} north, and he will go out with great fury to destroy and \textit{to} exterminate many.
\verse And \textit{then} he will pitch the tents of his palace between \textit{the} sea \textit{and} \textit{the beautiful holy mountain}, and he will come to his end, and there is no one helping him.”

\verseWithHeading{The Time of the Judgment and the Resurrection of Two Groups} “Now at that time, Michael, the great prince, will arise, \textit{the protector} over the sons of your people, and it will be a time of distress that has not been since \textit{your people} \textit{have been} a nation until that time. And at that time your people will escape, \textit{everyone who is found} written in the scroll.
\verse And many from \textit{those} sleeping \textit{in the dusty ground} will awake, some to \textit{everlasting life} and some to disgrace and \textit{everlasting contempt}.
\verse But the \textit{ones} having insight will shine like the brightness of the expanse, and \textit{the ones} providing justice \textit{for} the many \textit{will be} like the stars \textit{forever and ever}.
\verse But you, Daniel, keep the words secret and seal the scroll until \textit{the} time of \textit{the} end; many will run back and forth and knowledge will increase.”
\verse Then I looked, I myself, Daniel, and look, there were two others standing: \textit{one on this bank of the stream and one on the other}.
\verse Then he said to the man \textit{who} was clothed in linen who \textit{was} above the water of the stream, “\textit{How long until} the end of the wonders?”
\verse And I heard the man \textit{who} was clothed in linen who \textit{was} above the water of the stream, and he raised his right hand and his left hand to heaven and he swore \textit{by the one who lives forever} that \textit{an} appointed time, appointed times, and half \textit{an appointed time} \textit{would pass} when \textit{the} shattering of \textit{the power of the holy people} \textit{would be completed}; \textit{then} all these things will be accomplished.

\verse Many will be purified and will be cleansed and will be refined, but \textit{the} wicked will act wickedly \textit{and none of the wicked will understand}, but \textit{those who have insight} will understand.
\verse And from \textit{the} time the regular burnt offering is removed and \textit{the} abomination that causes desolation \textit{is set up} \textit{there will be} one thousand two hundred and ninety days.
\verse Happy \textit{is} the \textit{one who is} persevering, and attains \textit{to} \textit{the} one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.
\verse But you, go \textit{on} to the end and rest, and you will arise for your allotted inheritance at the end of the days.”
