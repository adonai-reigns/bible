\verseWithHeading{Daniel’s Development in the King’s Court} In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
\verse And the Lord gave Jehoiakim the king of Judah into his hand and \textit{some of} of the utensils of the temple of God, and he brought them to the land of Shinar to the temple of his gods, and he brought the utensils to \textit{the treasury} of his gods.
\verse And the king \textit{ordered} Ashpenaz, the commander of his court officials, to bring \textit{some of the Israelites} from \textit{the royal family} and from the lords,
\verse youths who \textit{have no physical defect}, and who are \textit{handsome}, and who are prudent in all wisdom and \textit{endowed with knowledge}, and who understand insight, and who have the \textit{ability} in them to serve in the palace of the king. And the king ordered him to teach them the literature and the language of the Chaldeans.
\verse And the king assigned to them \textit{his daily portion} from the fine food of the king, and from \textit{the wine that he drank}, and instructed that \textit{they were to be educated for three years}. And at the end of their training, \textit{they were to be stationed} \textit{before} the king.
\verse Now there was among them \textit{from the Judeans}, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.
\verse And the commander of the court officials gave them names, and he called Daniel, Belteshazzar; and Hananiah, Shadrach; and Mishael, Meshach; and Azariah, Abednego.
\verseWithHeading{Daniel’s Resolve} Now \textit{Daniel resolved} that he would not defile himself with the fine food of the king, and with \textit{the wine that he drank}, and so he requested from the commander of the court officials permission so that he would not defile himself.
\verse And God gave Daniel favor and compassion \textit{before} the commander of the court officials,
\verse and the commander of the court officials said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord, the king, who has determined your food and your drink, for \textit{why should} he see your face having a worse appearance than the young men who \textit{are your age}? Then you will endanger my head with the king.”
\verse Then Daniel asked the guard whom the commander of the court officials had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
\verse “Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us \textit{some of the vegetables}, and let us eat and let us drink water.
\verse Then let our appearances and the appearance of the young men who are eating the fine food of the king be compared \textit{before you}, and then deal with your servants \textit{according to what you see}.”
\verse So he agreed to this proposal with them, and he tested them for ten days.
\verse And at the end of ten days their appearances appeared better and they were healthier of body than all the young men who were eating the fine food of the king.
\verse \textit{So} the guard \textit{continued to withhold} their fine food and the wine of their drink, and he gave them vegetables.
\verse \textit{And as for these four young men}, God gave to them knowledge and insight into all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had insight into all visions and dreams.
\verse And at the end of the time the king had set to bring them, the commander of the court officials brought them in \textit{before} Nebuchadnezzar.
\verse And the king spoke with them, \textit{and among all of them no one was found like} Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; then they stood \textit{before} the king.
\verse And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired from them, he found them ten times better than all of the magicians and conjurers that \textit{were in his entire kingdom}.
\verse And Daniel was there until the first year of Cyrus the king.

\verseWithHeading{The King’s Troubling Dream} Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him.
\verse So the king said to call the magicians and the conjurers and the sorcerers and the \textit{astrologers} to tell to the king his dreams. And they came in and they stood \textit{before} the king.
\verse And the king said to them, “\textit{I have had a dream} and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.”
\verse And the \textit{astrologers} said to the king in Aramaic, “O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants and we will reveal the explanation.”
\verse The king answered and said to the \textit{astrologers}, “The command from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its explanation, then you will be broken into pieces and your houses will be laid in ruins.
\verse But if you tell me the dream and its explanation, you will receive gifts and rewards and great honor from me. Therefore, tell me the dream and its explanation.”
\verse They answered once more and said, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants and we will make the explanation known.”
\verse The king answered and said, “\textit{Certainly} I know that \textit{you are trying to gain time} \textit{because} you have seen \textit{that this matter is firmly decreed by me},
\verse for if you do not make the dream known to me, \textit{your verdict is fixed}, and you have conspired to say a lying and deceitful word to me until the \textit{circumstances} will change. Therefore, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can tell me its explanation.”
\verse The \textit{astrologers} answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth that is able to reveal the word of the king; \textit{in fact}, no great and powerful king has ever asked a thing like this of any magician or conjurer or \textit{astrologer}.
\verse And the thing that the king is asking is too difficult and \textit{there is no one who} can reveal it to the king except the gods \textit{whose dwelling is not with mortals}.”
\verse Because of this the king became angry, and he became very much enraged, and he said that all the wise men of Babylon are to be destroyed.
\verse And the decree was issued, and the wise men \textit{were on the verge of being executed}, and they searched for Daniel and his companions to be executed.
\verse Then Daniel responded prudently and discretely to Arioch, the commander of the imperial guard of the king, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon.
\verse \textit{He asked} and said to Arioch, the royal official of the king, “\textit{Why} is the decree from the king so severe?” Then Arioch explained the matter to Daniel.
\verse And Daniel went in and requested from the king that he would give him time, and \textit{he would tell the king} the explanation.
\verse Then Daniel went to his home, and he made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, his companions,
\verse and told them to seek mercy \textit{from the God of heaven} concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions, along with the remainder of the wise men of Babylon, would not be killed.
\verse Then in a vision of the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel; then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
\verse Daniel \textit{said}:
\verse “Let his name, the name of God, be blessed \textit{throughout the ages}, 
for the wisdom and the power \textit{are his}.
\verse And he changes the times and the seasons, 
and he deposes kings and he sets up kings; 
he gives wisdom to wise men 
and knowledge to men who know understanding.
\verse He reveals the deep and the hidden things; 
he knows what is in the darkness, 
and the light dwells with him.
\verseWithHeading{Daniel Praises God and Interprets the King’s Dream} \textit{Therefore} Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and thus he said to him: “You must not destroy the wise men of Babylon; take me in before the king and I will give the explanation to the king.”
\verse Then Arioch \textit{quickly} brought Daniel in before the king and thus he said to him: “I have found a man among \textit{the exiles} of Judah who \textit{can relate} the explanation to the king.
\verse \textit{The king then asked} and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its explanation?”
\verse Daniel answered the king and said, “The mystery that the king asks, no wise men, conjurers, magicians, or diviners are able to make known to the king.
\verse But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what it is that will be at the end of days. This is your dream and the visions of your head on your bed.
\verse “As for you, king, your thoughts on your bed \textit{turned to} what it was that would be \textit{in the future}, and the revealer of mysteries has made known to you what that would be.
\verse And as for me, it is not because of wisdom that is in me more than \textit{any other living person} that this mystery is revealed to me, but \textit{in order that} the explanation may be made known to the king and you will \textit{understand} the thoughts of your \textit{mind}.
\verse “You, O king, were looking and, look, there was one great statue. This statue was huge and its brilliance extraordinary, standing there before you, and its appearance was frightening.
\verse The head of this statue was of fine gold, its chest and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,
\verse its legs of iron, its feet, part of them of iron and part of them of clay.
\verse You were looking on \textit{until} a stone was chiseled out—that not by hands—and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, and it broke them in pieces.
\verse Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold \textit{all at once} broke into pieces and they became like chaff from the summer threshing floor, and the wind carried them away and any trace of them could not be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and it filled the whole earth.
\verse “This was the dream, and now we will tell its interpretation to the king.
\verse You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power and the might and the glory,
\verse and also \textit{human beings wherever they dwell}, the animals of the field and the birds of heaven—he has given into your hand and made you ruler over all of them—you are the head of gold.
\verse And after you another kingdom inferior to yours will arise, and another third kingdom of bronze that will rule over the whole earth.
\verse And a fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, and \textit{just as} iron crushes and smashes \textit{everything}, and as iron shatters all of these other metals, so it will crush and it will shatter these nations.
\verse \textit{And just as} you saw the feet and the toes, \textit{partly potter’s clay} and \textit{partly iron}, it will be a divided kingdom; and \textit{some hardness} of the iron will be in it, \textit{just as} you have seen the iron mixed with the wet clay.
\verse And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so part of the kingdom will be strong \textit{and partly brittle}.
\verse And in that you saw the iron was mixed with wet clay, so \textit{they will mix in marriage} and they will not cling \textit{to one another}, just as iron does not mix with clay.
\verse And \textit{in the day of those kings}, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will \textit{never} be destroyed, and the kingdom will not be left for another nation, and it will bring an end to all these kingdoms, but it will stand \textit{forever}.
\verse \textit{Inasmuch as} you saw that a stone from the mountain was chiseled out but not by hands, and that it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold, thereby the great God made known to the king what will be \textit{in the future}, and the dream is certain and its explanation trustworthy.”
\verseWithHeading{The King’s Response to Daniel and His God} Then the king, Nebuchadnezzar, fell on his face and he paid homage to Daniel; and he commanded them to offer a grain offering and incense offering to him.
\verse The king answered Daniel and said, “\textit{Truly} your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings, and he reveals mysteries, for you are able to reveal this mystery.”
\verse Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and the chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.
\verse And Daniel made a request from the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel remained in the court of the king.

\verseWithHeading{The Faithfulness of Three Young Israelites and God’s Deliverance} Nebuchadnezzar the king made a statue of gold. Its height was sixty cubits and its width was six cubits; he set it up in the valley of Dura in the province of Babylon.
\verse Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent directions to assemble the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all of the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
\verse Then the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the province were assembled for the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up, and were standing \textit{before} the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
\verse Then the herald proclaimed \textit{aloud}, “To you \textit{it is commanded}, O peoples, \textit{nations and people of all languages},
\verse that at the time that you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the trigon, the harp, the drum and all kinds of music, you must fall down and you must worship the statue of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.
\verse And \textit{whoever} does not fall down and worship will be thrown \textit{immediately} into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.”
\verse \textit{Therefore}, \textit{at that time}, \textit{as soon as} all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the trigon, the harp and all kinds of music, all the peoples, \textit{the nations and people of all languages} were falling down and were worshiping the statue of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
\verse \textit{Therefore} \textit{at this time} some \textit{astrologers} came forward and \textit{they denounced the Jews}.
\verse \textit{They responded and said} to Nebuchadnezzar the king, “O king, may you live \textit{forever}!
\verse You, O king, have made a decree that \textit{everyone} who hears the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the trigon, the harp and the drum and all kinds of music, he shall fall down and shall worship the statue of gold.
\verse \textit{And whoever} \textit{does not fall down} and worship shall be thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.
\verse However there are Judean men whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—these men, O king, \textit{pay you no heed} and were not serving your god, and the statue of gold that you set up they are not worshiping.”
\verse Then Nebuchadnezzar said in rage and anger to bring in Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego; then they brought in these men before the king.
\verse Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you are not serving my god, and you are not worshiping the statue of gold that I have set up?
\verse Now if you are ready so that \textit{when} you hear the sound of the horn, the flute, the lyre, the trigon, the harp and the drum and all kinds of music, you fall down and you worship the statue that I have made, that will be good. But if you do not worship it, \textit{immediately} you will be thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire, and \textit{who is the god} who will rescue you from my hands?”
\verse Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king, Nebuchadnezzar, “We have no need on this matter \textit{to present a defense to you}.
\verse \textit{If it is so}, our God, whom we serve, is able to rescue us from the furnace of blazing fire. And from your hand, O king, let him rescue us.
\verse And if not, let it be known to you, O king, that \textit{we will not serve your gods}, and the statue of gold that you have set up we will not worship.”
\verseWithHeading{The Wrath of the King and His Fiery Furnace of Death} Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with anger and the image of his face was changed \textit{toward} Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, so he \textit{ordered and said} to heat up the one furnace seven times what was usual to heat it up.
\verse And he commanded \textit{the strongest men of the guards} who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire.
\verse Then these men were bound with their garments, their trousers and their turbans and their other clothing, and they were thrown into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire.
\verse \textit{Therefore} \textit{because} the word of the king was severe and the furnace was exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed these men who lifted up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.
\verse But these men, the three of them, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, fell down into the midst of the furnace of blazing fire, and they were bound.
\verse Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and he rose up in haste and he asked, saying to his advisers, “Did we not throw three men, bound, into the midst of the fire? They answered, saying to the king, “Certainly, O king!”
\verse \textit{He answered}, saying, “Look, I see four men unbound walking in the midst of the fire and there is no damage to them, and the appearance of the fourth man resembles the son of a god.”
\verse Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire, and he called out, saying, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, \textit{servants} of the Most High God, come out and come here!”
\verse And the satraps, the prefects, the governors and the advisors of the king were assembling, and they saw these men, that the fire had no power over their bodies, and the hair of their heads was not singed, and their garments were not harmed, and the smell of fire did not come from them.
\verseWithHeading{The King’s Praise for the Great Deliverance of the Three Young Israelites} Nebuchadnezzar \textit{responded}, saying, “Blessed be their God, the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who sent his angel and rescued his servants who trusted in him, and the command of the king they disobeyed, and they gave their bodies so that they did not serve and did not worship any god except their God.
\verse And from me \textit{is set forth} a decree that any people, nation, or language that may utter criticism against their God—the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego—will be broken into pieces and their house will be made like ruins. \textit{For} there is not another God who is able to rescue like this God.”
\verse Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.

\verseWithHeading{Nebuchadnezzar Declares What the Most High God Has Done for Him}  Nebuchadnezzar the king to all of the nations, the peoples and languages that live in the whole earth: “May your prosperity increase!
\verse It is pleasing to me to recount the signs and wonders that the Most High God worked for me.
\verse How great are his signs and wonders, how strong is his kingdom, \textit{an everlasting kingdom}; and his sovereignty is from generation to generation.
\verseWithHeading{The Dream and the King’s Search for an Interpreter} “I, Nebuchadnezzar, was content in my house and prospering in my palace.
\verse And I saw a dream and a revelation on my bed and it frightened me, and the visions of my head terrified me.
\verse And a decree was \textit{sent out}, ordering that all the wise men of Babylon were to be brought in before me so that they may make known to me the explanation of the dream.
\verse Then the magicians, the conjurers, the \textit{astrologers} and the diviners came in and I told them the dream, but they could not make known to me its explanation.
\verse Then \textit{at last} Daniel came before me \textit{whose name was} Belteshazzar, \textit{according to} the name of my god, and \textit{in whom was the spirit of the holy gods}, \textit{and I related the dream to him}.
\verse “ ‘O Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I myself know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and \textit{no mystery is too difficult} for you. Now tell me the visions of my dream that I saw, and its explanation.
\verse Now these were the visions of my head as I was lying on my bed: I was \textit{gazing} and, look, a tree was in the midst of the earth, and its height was exalted.
\verse The tree grew and it became strong, 
and its height reached to heaven, 
and \textit{it was visible to the end of the whole earth}.
\verse Its foliage was beautiful, 
and its fruit abundant, 
and in it was provision for all. 
Under it the animals of the field sought shade, 
and in its branches the birds of heaven nested, 
and from it all the living beings were fed.
\verse “ ‘I was looking in the vision of my head as I lay on my bed, and look, a watcher, and a holy one, came down from heaven.
\verse He cried \textit{aloud} and so he said:
\verse “Cut down the tree and chop off its branches; 
shake off its foliage and scatter its fruit. 
Let the animals flee from under it, 
and the birds from its branches.
\verse But the stump of its roots 
leave in the earth, 
\textit{along with} a band of iron and bronze; 
leave it in the grass of the field. 
And in the dew of heaven 
let it be watered, 
and with the animals 
let his lot be in the grass of the earth.
\verse Let his mind be changed from that of a human, 
and let the mind of an animal be given to him, 
and let seven times pass over him.
\verse “ ‘This is the dream that I, Nebuchadnezzar the king, saw. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare its explanation, \textit{for} all of the wise men of my kingdom were not able to make the explanation known to me, but you are able because the spirit of holy gods is in you.’
\verseWithHeading{Daniel Relates and Interprets the Dream} “Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was distressed \textit{for some time}, and his thoughts disturbed him. The king answered and he said, ‘Belteshazzar, let the dream and its explanation not disturb you.’ Belteshazzar answered and said, ‘My lord, may the dream and its explanation be for those who hate you and for your enemies.
\verse The tree that you saw, which grew and became strong and its height reached to heaven and \textit{it was visible to the end of the whole earth},
\verse and its foliage was beautiful and its fruit abundant, and so there was provision for all in it, and the animals of the field lived under it and in its branches nest the birds of heaven,
\verse —it is you, O king, who have grown great and you have grown strong, and so your greatness has increased and it has reached to heaven and your sovereignty to the end of the earth.
\verse And inasmuch that the king saw the watcher, a holy one coming down from heaven and he said, “Cut down the tree and destroy it, but the stump of its root in the earth leave with a band of iron and bronze in the grass of the field, and let it be watered with the dew of heaven and let his lot be with the animals of the field \textit{until seven times have passed over him}.”
\verse This is the explanation, O king, and it is a decree of the Most High that has come upon my lord the king:
\verse you will be driven away \textit{from human society} and \textit{you will dwell} with the animals of the field, and you will be caused to graze grass like the oxen \textit{yourself}, and you will be watered with the dew of heaven, and seven periods of time will pass over you until that you have acknowledged that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdom of humankind, and \textit{to whom he wills} he gives it.
\verse \textit{And in that} they said to leave alone the stump of the tree’s root, so your kingdom will be restored for you \textit{when} you acknowledge that heaven is sovereign.
\verse Therefore, O king, let my advice be acceptable to you and your sin remove with righteousness and your iniquity with having mercy on the oppressed, \textit{in case there might be a prolongation of your prosperity}.’ ”
\verseWithHeading{God Judges the King for His Hubris} \textit{All this happened} to Nebuchadnezzar the king.
\verse At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of \textit{the royal palace} of Babylon.
\verse And the king answered and said, “Is this not the great Babylon which I have built as a royal palace by the strength of my own power, and for the glory of my own majesty?”
\verse While the words were still in the mouth of the king, a voice from heaven came, saying, ‘To you, King Nebuchadnezzar, it is declared that the kingdom has departed from you,
\verse and you will be driven away from \textit{human society} and your dwelling will be with the animals of the field and they will cause you to graze the grass like oxen, and seven times will pass over you, until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdom of humankind and that he gives it to whom he wills.’
\verse \textit{Immediately} the word was fulfilled \textit{concerning} Nebuchadnezzar, and he was expelled from \textit{human society} and he ate grass like oxen, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven until his hair was like the hair of an eagle and his nails grew like a bird’s claws.
\verseWithHeading{The King Praises and Extols the Most High God} “But at the end of \textit{that period}, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and then my reason returned to me; and I blessed the Most High and \textit{the one who lives forever} I praised and I honored.
\verse “For his sovereignty is an everlasting sovereignty, 
and his kingdom continues from generation to generation.
\verse “\textit{At that time} my reason returned to me, and also the glory of my kingdom and my majesty and splendor returned to me, and my advisers and my lords searched me out, and I was established over my kingdom and abundant greatness was added to me.
\verse Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor the king of heaven, for all his works are truth, and his ways are justice and that he is able to humble those who walk in pride.”

\verseWithHeading{The Mysterious Writing on the Wall} Belshazzar the king made a great festival for a thousand of his lords, and \textit{in the presence of} the thousand lords he was drinking wine.
\verse \textit{When he tasted the wine}, Belshazzar commanded that they bring the vessels of gold and silver that Nebuchadnezzar his \textit{predecessor} had taken from the temple that was in Jerusalem, so that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines may drink from them.
\verse Then they brought in the vessels of gold that they took from the temple, the house of God that was in Jerusalem, and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines drank from them.
\verse They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood and stone.
\verse \textit{Immediately} \textit{human fingers} appeared and they wrote \textit{opposite} the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the palace of the king, and the king was watching the palm of the hand that was writing.
\verse Then his face changed and his thoughts terrified him, and \textit{his hip joints gave way} and \textit{his knees knocked together}.
\verse The king cried \textit{aloud} to bring in the conjurers, the \textit{astrologers} and the diviners; the king \textit{spoke} and said to the wise men of Babylon, “Any man that can read this writing and can tell me its explanation will be clothed in purple and will have a necklace of gold hung around his neck and he will rule as third in authority in the kingdom.”
\verse Then all the wise men of the king came in, but they were not able to read the writing or to make known its explanation.
\verse Then the king, Belshazzar, became greatly terrified, and \textit{his facial features} changed upon him, and his lords were perplexed.
\verse Because of the words of the king and his lords, the queen came into \textit{the banqueting hall} and the queen \textit{spoke up} and said, “O king, live \textit{forever}, and let not your thoughts terrify you and do not let your facial expressions \textit{grow pale}.
\verse There is a man in your kingdom \textit{who has the spirit of the holy gods in him}. And in the days of your \textit{predecessor}, enlightenment and insight and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods was found in him; and, O king, Nebuchadnezzar your \textit{predecessor} appointed him as chief of the magicians, the conjurers, the \textit{astrologers}, and the diviners. Your \textit{predecessor} the king did this
\verse \textit{because} there was found in him an excellent spirit and understanding and insight for interpreting dreams and explaining riddles and solving riddles; that is, in Daniel \textit{whom the king named} Belteshazzar. Now, let Daniel be called and he will tell the explanation.”
\verseWithHeading{Daniel Deciphers and Interprets the Writing} Then Daniel was brought in before the king, and the king \textit{spoke} and said to Daniel, “You are Daniel \textit{who are one of the exiles} of Judah whom my \textit{predecessor}, the king, brought from Judah.
\verse And I have heard that a spirit of the gods is in you and enlightenment and insight and excellent wisdom was found in you.
\verse And now the wise men and the conjurers were brought in before me so that they could read this writing in order to make its explanation known to me, but they were not able to disclose the explanation of the matter.
\verse But I have heard concerning you that you are able \textit{to produce interpretations} and to solve riddles; now if you are able to read the writing and to make known its explanation to me, you will be clothed in purple and a necklace of gold will be placed around your neck and you will rule as third in command in the kingdom.”
\verse Then Daniel answered and said before the king, “Let your gifts be for yourself or your rewards give to another; nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and I will make known to him the explanation.
\verse \textit{O king}, the Most High God gave the kingdom and the greatness and the glory and the majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your \textit{predecessor}.
\verse And because of the greatness that he gave to him, all the peoples, the nations and languages trembled and feared before him; whomever he wanted he killed, and whomever he wanted he let live, and whomever he wanted he honored, and whomever he wanted he humbled.
\verse But \textit{when} his heart became arrogant and his spirit became hard so as to act proudly, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom and the glory \textit{was taken away from him}.
\verse And he was driven away \textit{from human society} and his mind was made like the animals and his dwelling was with the wild asses; and \textit{he was given} grass like oxen to eat, and with the dew of heaven his body was bathed, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over the kingdom of humankind, and \textit{whoever} he wants he sets over it.
\verse “But you his \textit{successor}, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart \textit{even though} you knew all this.
\verse And now you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven, and the vessels of his temple you have brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines, have been drinking wine from them, and you have praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone that do not see and do not hear and do not know, but the God \textit{who holds your life in his hand} and all of your ways \textit{come from him}, you have not honored.
\verse So then the palm of the hand was sent out from his presence and this writing was inscribed.
\verse “Now this was the writing that was inscribed: ‘Mene, Mene, Tekel and Parsin.’
\verse “This is the explanation of the matter: ‘Mene’—God has numbered your kingdom and brought an end to it.
\verse “ ‘Tekel’—you have been weighed on scales and you have been found wanting.
\verse “ ‘Peres’—your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians.’ ”
\verse Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple and placed a necklace of gold around his neck, and they made a proclamation concerning him that he would be the third ruler in authority in the kingdom.
\verse \textit{That same night} Belshazzar, the Chaldean king, was killed.

\verseWithHeading{Daniel’s Integrity and His Entrapment by His Enemies} \textit{It pleased Darius}, and he set up one hundred and twenty satraps over the kingdom, that they were \textit{throughout the whole kingdom},
\verse and over them were three administrators, of whom Daniel was one, so that these satraps were giving account to them, and the king would not be suffering loss.
\verse Then Daniel \textit{began distinguishing himself} above the administrators and the satraps \textit{because} an exceptional spirit was in him, and so the king planned to appoint him over the whole kingdom.
\verse Then the other administrators and satraps \textit{began to seek} to find a pretext against Daniel \textit{in connection with the kingdom}, but they were not able to find any pretext and \textit{corruption} \textit{because} he was trustworthy, and no negligence or \textit{corruption} \textit{could be found in him}.
\verse Then these men \textit{said}, “We will not find any pretext against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.”
\verse So the administrators and the satraps conspired \textit{with respect to} the king and so they said to him, “Darius, O king, live \textit{forever}!
\verse All of the administrators of the kingdom, and the prefects, the satraps, the counselors and the governors took counsel and have agreed to establish an edict of the king and to enforce a decree that \textit{whoever} will seek a prayer from any god or human except from you for up to thirty days will be thrown into \textit{the lion pit}.
\verse Now, O king, establish the edict and you must sign the document so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians which cannot be revoked.”
\verse \textit{So} the king, Darius, signed the writing and the interdict.
\verse Now \textit{when} Daniel realized that the document was signed, he went to his house (\textit{now he had windows in his upper room that were open} toward Jerusalem), and three times \textit{daily} he knelt on his knees and prayed and gave praise before his God, \textit{just as} he had been doing \textit{previously}.
\verse Then these men came as a group and they found Daniel praying and pleading for mercy before his God.
\verse Then they approached \textit{and spoke with the king} concerning the edict of the king, “\textit{Did you not sign an edict} that any person who would seek anything from any God or human within thirty days except from you, O king, would be thrown into \textit{the lion pit}?” The king answered and said, “The matter as you have just stated is certain according to the law of the Medes and Persians which cannot be revoked.”
\verseWithHeading{God’s Miraculous Deliverance of Daniel Again} Then \textit{they responded} and said before the king, “Daniel, who is from \textit{the exiles} of Judah, \textit{is not paying any attention} to you, O king, or to the decree that you have signed, \textit{and three times daily} he says his prayer.”
\verse Then the king, when he heard that \textit{report}, he was extremely distressed over it; and \textit{concerning Daniel} \textit{he was determined} to rescue him. And until the setting of the sun he was making every effort to deliver him.
\verse Then these men came as a group to the king and \textit{said}, “Recall, O king, that with respect to the law of the Medes and Persians that \textit{any} decree or edict that the king establishes cannot be changed.”
\verse Then the king gave the command, and Daniel was brought in and they threw him into \textit{the lion pit}. \textit{The king said} to Daniel, “Your God, whom you serve \textit{faithfully}, may he rescue you!”
\verse And a stone was brought and it was put on the entrance of the pit, and the king sealed it with his signet ring and with the signet rings of his lords, so that nothing would be changed concerning Daniel.
\verse Then the king went to his palace and spent the night in fasting, and no food was brought in before him and his sleep fled from him.
\verse Then the king got up at daybreak, at first light, and he went \textit{in haste} to \textit{the lion pit}.
\verse And \textit{when he came near} to the pit, he cried out to Daniel with a distressed voice, and the king \textit{spoke} and said to Daniel, “O Daniel, servant of the living God, your God whom you serve faithfully, was he able to rescue you from the lions?”
\verse Then Daniel spoke to the king, “O king, live \textit{forever}!
\verse My God sent his angel and he shut the mouth of the lions and they did not hurt me, \textit{because} before him \textit{I was found} blameless, and also before you, O king, I have not done any wrong.”
\verse Then the king was exceedingly glad over it and commanded that Daniel be lifted up from the pit; and there was not any wound found on him, because he had trusted in his God.
\verse The king then commanded, and these men were brought \textit{who had accused Daniel}, and they threw them and their children and their wives into \textit{the lion pit}, and they had not reached the floor of the pit \textit{before} the lions had overpowered them and they had crushed all of their bones.
\verseWithHeading{The King Praises the God of Daniel and Daniel Prospers} Then Darius the king wrote to all the people, the nations, and the languages living in the whole earth, “May your prosperity become great!

\verseWithHeading{Daniel’s Vision of Four Beasts and the Son of Man} In the first year of Belshazzar the king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay on his bed; then he wrote down the dream and the \textit{summary} of the words \textit{as follows}:
\verse Daniel \textit{explained} and said, “I was looking in my vision in the night, and look, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea.
\verse And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, differing \textit{from one another}.
\verse The first was like a lion and \textit{had} the wings of an eagle. I was watching until its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the earth and it was raised on its feet like a human, and a human heart was given to it.
\verse And look, another beast, a second one, looking like a bear. And it was raised up on one side and three tusks were in its mouth between its teeth, and so \textit{it was told}, “Arise, eat much flesh!”
\verse After this I was watching and look, another beast like a leopard; \textit{it had four wings} of a bird on its back, and \textit{the beast had} four heads, and dominion was given to it.
\verse After this in the visions of the night I was looking and there was a fourth beast, terrifying and frightful and exceedingly strong, and \textit{it had} \textit{great iron teeth}, and it was devouring and crushing, and it stamped the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the other beasts \textit{that preceded it} \textit{and it had ten horns}.
\verse I was considering the horns, and look, another little horn came up \textit{among} them, and three of the earlier horns \textit{were rooted out} from before it, and there were eyes like the eyes of a human in this horn and also a mouth that was speaking boastfully.
\verse “\textit{I continued watching} until thrones were placed and an Ancient of Days sat; his clothing was like white snow and the hair of his head was like pure wool and his throne was a flame of fire and its wheels were burning fire.
\verse A stream of fire issued forth and flowed \textit{from his presence}; thousands upon thousands served him and ten thousand upon ten thousand stood before him. The judge sat, and the books were opened.
\verse “\textit{I continued watching} then because of the noise of the boastful words of the horn who was speaking; \textit{I continued watching} until the beast was slain and its body was destroyed, and it was given over to burning with fire.
\verse And as for the remainder of the beasts, \textit{their dominion was taken away}, but a prolongation \textit{of their life} was given to them for a season and a time.
\verse “\textit{I continued watching} in the visions of the night, and look, with the clouds of heaven one like a son of man was coming, and he came to the Ancient of Days, and \textit{was presented} before him.
\verse And to him was given dominion and glory and kingship that all the peoples, the nations, and languages would serve him; his dominion is a dominion \textit{without end} that will not cease, and his kingdom is one that will not be destroyed.
\verseWithHeading{Daniel Explains and Interprets the Vision} “\textit{As for me, Daniel}, my spirit was troubled \textit{within me}, and the visions of my head terrified me.
\verse So I approached one of the attendants and I asked him about the truth concerning all this; and he told me that he would make known to me the explanation of the matter.
\verse ‘These great beasts which are four in number are four kings who will arise from the earth.
\verse But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom, and they will take possession of the kingdom forever, \textit{forever and ever}.’
\verse “Then I desired to make certain concerning the fourth beast that was different from \textit{all the others}—exceedingly terrifying, with its iron teeth and its claws of bronze; it devoured and crushed and stamped the remainder with its feet—
\verse and concerning the horns that were on its head, and concerning the other horn that came up and \textit{before which three horns fell}, and this horn \textit{had eyes} and a mouth speaking \textit{boastfully}, and its appearance was larger than its companions.
\verse \textit{I continued watching}, and this horn made war with the holy ones and it prevailed over them,
\verse until the Ancient of Days came and gave judgment to the holy ones of the Most High; and the time arrived and the holy ones took possession of the kingdom.
\verse “And he said, ‘The fourth beast is the fourth kingdom that will be on the earth that will be different from all the other kingdoms, and it will devour the whole earth and it will trample it and it will crush it.
\verse And as for the ten horns coming from it, from this kingdom ten kings will arise, and another will arise after them. And he will be different from the earlier ones, and he will subdue three kings.
\verse And he will speak words against the Most High, and he will wear out the holy ones of the Most High, and he will attempt to change times and law, and they will be given into his hand for a time and two times and half a time.
\verse Then the court will sit, and his dominion will be removed, to be eradicated and to be destroyed \textit{totally}.
\verse And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the nation of the holy ones of the Most High; his kingdom \textit{is an everlasting kingdom}, and all the dominions will serve and obey him.’
\verse \textit{This is the end of the account}. \textit{As for me, Daniel}—my thoughts terrified me greatly and my face changed over me, but I kept the matter in my heart.”

\verseWithHeading{The Vision of a Small Horn that Oppresses Israel and Threatens the Temple} In the third year of the kingdom of Belshazzar the king, a vision appeared \textit{to me, Daniel}, after the one that appeared to me \textit{previously}.
\verse And I saw in the vision, \textit{and when I saw}, I was in Susa, the citadel that was in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and \textit{I myself} was at the stream of Ulai.
\verse And I lifted up my eyes and I saw, and look! A ram standing \textit{before} the stream, and \textit{it had} two horns, and the horns were long, but the one was longer than the second, and the longer one came up \textit{after the other one}.
\verse I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward, and \textit{none of the beasts stood before it}, and there was no rescuing from \textit{its power}, and it did \textit{what it wanted} and it became strong.
\verse And I was considering this, and look, a he-goat coming from the west across the face of the whole earth, and it was not touching the ground; and the he-goat had \textit{a conspicuous horn} between its eyes.
\verse Then it came toward the ram \textit{that had the two horns} that I saw standing \textit{before} the stream, and it ran at it with the rage of its power.
\verse And I saw it approaching the ram and it was furious at it, and it struck the ram, and it broke its two horns, and \textit{there was not strength in the ram to stand before him}, and he threw it down to the ground and trampled it, \textit{and there was no one who could rescue the ram} from its power.
\verse And the he-goat grew \textit{exceedingly great}, and \textit{at the height of its power} the great horn was broken, and four conspicuous horns came up in place of it toward the four winds of heaven.
\verse \textit{And from one of them} came forth a horn, \textit{a little one}, and it grew exceedingly toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beautiful land.
\verse And it grew up to the host of heaven, and it threw down to the ground some of the host and some of the stars and trampled them.
\verse Even against the prince of the hosts it acted arrogantly and took away from him the regular burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown.
\verse And on account of transgression, the host was given over to the horn in addition to the regular burnt offering. And it cast down truth to the ground, and it \textit{acted}, and it had success.
\verse And I heard a certain holy one speaking, and a certain other holy one said to the specific one \textit{who was speaking}, “\textit{For how long} is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering, and the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and the host to trampling?”
\verse And he said to me, “For two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings, then the sanctuary will be restored.”
\verseWithHeading{Gabriel Gives Angelic Help and Interprets the Vision} \textit{And then} when I, Daniel, saw the vision, and I was seeking understanding, there was one standing before me with the appearance of a man.
\verse And I heard the voice of a human at the Ulai, and he called and said, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.”
\verse And he came beside \textit{where I was standing}, and \textit{when he came} I became terrified and I fell prostrate on my face. And he said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.”
\verse And \textit{when he spoke} with me I fell into a trance with my face to the ground, and he touched me and made me stand on by feet.
\verse And he said, “Look, I am making known to you what will happen in the period of wrath, for it refers to the appointed time of the end.
\verse “The ram that you saw \textit{who had two horns} represents the kings of Media and Persia.
\verse “And the hairy he-goat is the \textit{kingdom} of Greece, and the great horn that is between his eyes—he is the first king.
\verse And the horn that was broken, and then there arose four horns in place of it—these are four kingdoms that will arise from his nation, but not with his power.
\verse And at the end of their kingdom, when the transgressions are completed, a king will arise, fierce in countenance and skilled in riddles.
\verse And his power will grow, but not by his own power, and he will cause fearful destruction, and he will succeed and \textit{he will act}, and he will destroy the mighty and the people of the holy ones.
\verse And by his planning he will make a success of deceit by his hand, and in his \textit{mind} he will \textit{boast}, and in their ease he will destroy many, and even against the prince of princes he will rise up, and he will be broken, but not by human hands.
\verse And the vision of the evening and the morning that has been \textit{described}, it is true; and you, seal up the vision, for \textit{it refers to many days to come}.”

\verse Then I turned my face to the Lord God to seek him by prayer and pleas for mercy, in fasting and in sackcloth and ashes.
\verse And I prayed to Adonai my God, and I made confession and I said, “O Lord, the great and awesome God, keeping the covenant and loyal love with those who love him and with those who keep his commandments,
\verse we have sinned and we have done wrong and we acted wickedly and we rebelled and have been turning aside from your commandments and from your ordinances.

\verse Just as it is written in the law of Moses, all of this calamity has come upon us, and \textit{we have not implored} the face of Adonai our God so as to turn from our iniquities and to attend closely to your faithfulness.
\verse So Adonai has kept watch over the calamity, and now he has brought it upon us. Indeed, Adonai our God is righteous concerning all his works that he has done, but we have not listened to his voice.

\verse Lord, according to all your righteousness, please let your anger and your rage turn away from your city Jerusalem, \textit{your holy mountain}, because through our sins and through the iniquities of our ancestors Jerusalem and your people have become an object of mockery among all of our neighbors.

\verse \textit{And two of the kings} \textit{will bend their hearts} to evil. And at the \textit{same table} they will speak lies, but what is discussed will not succeed, for still an end is coming at the appointed time.
\verse Then he will return to his land with many possessions, but his heart will be set against \textit{the holy covenant}, and he will take action and he will return to his land.
\verse “At the appointed time he will return and he will come into the south, but it will not be \textit{as it was before}.
\verse And the ships of Kittim will come against him, and he will lose heart, and he will turn back, and he will be enraged \textit{against the holy covenant}, and he will take action, and he will turn back, and he will pay attention to those who forsake \textit{the holy covenant}.
\verse And military forces from him \textit{will occupy} and will profane the \textit{sanctuary stronghold}, and they will abolish the regular burnt offering, and they will set up the abomination that causes desolation.
\verse “And those who violate the covenant he will seduce with flattery, but the persons who know their God will stand firm and will take action.
\verse And those who have insight \textit{will instruct} the many, but they will fall by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder \textit{for some time}.
\verse And \textit{when they fall} they will receive little help, and many will join with them in hypocrisy.
\verse And even some of those \textit{who have insight}﻿ will fall in order for them to be refined by it, and to be purified and cleansed until the time of the end, for the appointed time is still to come.
\verse “Then the king will do \textit{as he pleases}, and he will exalt himself and will consider himself above any god, and he will speak horrendous things \textit{against} the God of gods, yet he will succeed until the period of anger is finished, for what is determined will be done.
\verse He will not pay respect to the gods of his ancestors, or to the darling of women, and not to any god will he pay respect, for he will consider himself great over all gods.
\verse But \textit{instead} he will honor the god of fortresses, a god whom his ancestors did not know. He will honor him with gold, and with silver, and with precious stones and with costly gifts.
\verse And he will deal with the \textit{fortified strongholds} with the help of \textit{a foreign god}; and he will increase wealth for whoever will acknowledge him, and he will cause them to rule over the many, and he will distribute land for a price.
\verse “And at the time of the end the king of the south will attack him, and the king of the north will storm against him with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships, and he will advance against the countries and \textit{he will sweep through like a flood}.
\verse And he will come \textit{into the beautiful land} and many will fall victim, but these will escape from his power: Edom and Moab and the best part of the \textit{Ammonites}.
\verse And he will stretch out his hand against countries and the land of Egypt \textit{will not escape}.
\verse And he will rule over the treasures of gold and the silver and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Cushites will follow in his footsteps.

\verse And then he will pitch the tents of his palace between the sea and \textit{the beautiful holy mountain}, and he will come to his end, and there is no one helping him.”

\verseWithHeading{The Time of the Judgment and the Resurrection of Two Groups} “Now at that time, Michael, the great prince, will arise, \textit{the protector} over the sons of your people, and it will be a time of distress that has not been since your people \textit{have been} a nation until that time. And at that time your people will escape, \textit{everyone who is found} written in the scroll.
\verse And many from those sleeping \textit{in the dusty ground} will awake, some to \textit{everlasting life} and some to disgrace and \textit{everlasting contempt}.
\verse But the ones having insight will shine like the brightness of the expanse, and the ones providing justice for the many will be like the stars \textit{forever and ever}.
\verse But you, Daniel, keep the words secret and seal the scroll until the time of the end; many will run back and forth and knowledge will increase.”
\verse Then I looked, I myself, Daniel, and look, there were two others standing: \textit{one on this bank of the stream and one on the other}.
\verse Then he said to the man who was clothed in linen who was above the water of the stream, “\textit{How long until} the end of the wonders?”
\verse And I heard the man who was clothed in linen who was above the water of the stream, and he raised his right hand and his left hand to heaven and he swore \textit{by the one who lives forever} that an appointed time, appointed times, and half an appointed time would pass when the shattering of \textit{the power of the holy people} \textit{would be completed}; then all these things will be accomplished.
\verseWithHeading{Daniel Seeks Additional Insights} Now I myself heard, but I did not understand, and I said, “My lord, what will be the outcome of these things?”
\verse And he said, “Go, Daniel, for the words are secret and are sealed up until the time of the end.
\verse Many will be purified and will be cleansed and will be refined, but the wicked will act wickedly \textit{and none of the wicked will understand}, but \textit{those who have insight} will understand.
\verse And from the time the regular burnt offering is removed and the abomination that causes desolation \textit{is set up} there will be one thousand two hundred and ninety days.
\verse Happy is the one who is persevering, and attains to the one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.
\verse But you, go on to the end and rest, and you will arise for your allotted inheritance at the end of the days.”
