\verse In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Adonai came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, son of Iddo, saying,
\verse “Adonai \textit{was very angry with your ancestors}.
\verse You must say to them: ‘Thus says Adonai of hosts: “Return to me,” \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts, “and I will return to you,” says Adonai of hosts.
\verse “Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, ‘Thus says Adonai of hosts: “Return from your evil ways and your evil deeds!” ’ But they did not hear and they did not pay attention to me,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “Your ancestors, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?
\verse However, did not my words and my regulations which I commanded my servants the prophets overtake your ancestors? And they repented and said, ‘Adonai of hosts planned to do with us according to our ways, and according to our deeds so he has dealt with us.’ ” ’ ”
\verseWithHeading{Zechariah’s First Vision} On the twenty-fourth day of \textit{the} eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of Adonai came to Zechariah the prophet, son of Berekiah, son of Iddo, saying,
\verse \textit{I had a vision in the night}, and look, a man riding on a red horse. And he \textit{was} standing between the myrtle shrubs that \textit{were} in the ravine, and behind him \textit{were} red, reddish-brown, and white horses.
\verse And I asked, “What \textit{are} these, my lord?” And the angel \textit{who was} talking with me said, “I will show you what these are.”
\verse And the man standing between the myrtle shrubs answered and said, “These \textit{are} those whom Adonai has sent to patrol \textit{the} earth.”
\verse And they answered the angel of Adonai who was standing between the myrtle shrubs, and they said, “We have patrolled the earth, and look, all the earth \textit{is dwelling in peace}.”
\verse The angel of Adonai answered and said, “O Adonai of hosts, \textit{how long} will you have no compassion on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, \textit{with} which you showed fury these seventy years?”
\verse \textit{With} gracious and comforting words Adonai answered the angel who was talking with me.
\verse And the angel who was talking with me said to me, “Proclaim, saying, ‘Thus says Adonai of hosts: “\textit{I am very jealous} for Jerusalem and for Zion!
\verse And \textit{I am extremely angry} with the nations that are at ease, for \textit{while} I was a little angry, they \textit{furthered disaster}.”
\verse Therefore, thus says Adonai: “I have returned to Jerusalem with compassion. My temple will be built in it,” \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts, “and a measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.” ’
\verse Proclaim again, saying, ‘Thus says Adonai of hosts: “My cities shall again overflow from prosperity, and Adonai will comfort Zion again, and he will choose Jerusalem again.” ’ ”
\verseWithHeading{Zechariah’s Second Vision}  And I \textit{looked up} and I saw, and look, \textit{there were} four horns!
\verse And I said to the angel \textit{who was} talking with me, “What \textit{are} these?” And he said to me, “These \textit{are} the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
\verse Then Adonai showed me four skilled craftsmen,
\verse and I asked, “What \textit{are} these coming to do?” And he answered, saying, “These \textit{are} the horns that scattered Judah, \textit{so that no man} lifted up his head; but these have come to frighten them, to strike down the horns of the nations that lifted a horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.”

\verseWithHeading{Zechariah’s Third Vision} And I \textit{looked up} and I saw, and look, a man, and in his hand \textit{was} a measuring rope!
\verse And I asked, “Where \textit{are} you going?” And he answered me, “To measure Jerusalem to see what \textit{is} its width and what \textit{is} its length.”
\verse And look, the angel who was talking to me \textit{was} coming forward, and another angel \textit{was} coming forward to meet him.
\verse And he said to him, “Run, say to that young man, ‘Jerusalem shall be inhabited \textit{like villages without walls} because of the multitude of people and animals in its midst.
\verse And I will be for it a wall of fire all around,’ \textit{declares} Adonai, ‘and I will be \textit{the} glory in its midst.’ ”
\verse “Woe! Woe! Flee from \textit{the} land of \textit{the} north,” \textit{declares} Adonai, “for I have scattered you like \textit{the} four winds of the heavens,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “Woe, Zion! Escape, you inhabitants of \textit{the} daughter of Babylon!”
\verse For thus said Adonai of hosts, after glory he sent me against the nations plundering you: Truly, the one touching you \textit{is} touching the apple of his eye.
\verse “Yes, look! I \textit{am} going to wave my hand against them, and they will become plunder for their servants, and you will know that Adonai of hosts has sent me.
\verse Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for look, I \textit{am} coming and I will dwell in your midst,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “Many nations will join themselves to Adonai on that day, and they will be my people, and I will dwell in your midst. And you will know that Adonai of hosts has sent me to you.
\verse And Adonai will inherit Judah \textit{as} his portion \textit{in the holy land}, and he will again choose Jerusalem.
\verse Be silent, \textit{all people}, before Adonai, for he is roused from \textit{his holy dwelling}.”

\verseWithHeading{Zechariah’s Fourth Vision} And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing \textit{before} the angel of Adonai; and Satan was standing on his right to accuse him.
\verse But Adonai said to Satan, “Adonai rebukes you, O Satan! Adonai who has chosen Jerusalem rebukes you! \textit{Is} this not a stick snatched from the fire?”
\verse And Joshua was clothed \textit{in} filthy garments and was standing \textit{before} the angel.
\verse And he answered and said to the ones standing \textit{before} him, saying, “Remove the filthy garments from him.” And he said to him, “See, I have taken away your guilt from you, and will clothe you \textit{with} rich garments.”
\verse And I said, “Let them put a clean headband on his head.” And they put a clean headband on his head, and they clothed him \textit{with} garments. And the angel of Adonai \textit{was} standing \textit{by}.
\verse And the angel of Adonai assured Joshua, saying,
\verse “Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my requirements, then you will judge my house, and you will also guard my courtyards, and I will give to you passageways among these that are standing here.
\verse Listen, please, O Joshua the high priest, you and your companions that are sitting \textit{before} you. For \textit{the} men \textit{are} a sign that, look, I \textit{am} going to bring my servant \textit{the} Branch.
\verse For consider, the stone that \textit{I set before} Joshua, on one stone \textit{are} seven eyes. Look, \textit{I am going to engrave an inscription on it},’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts, ‘and I will remove the guilt of that land in a single day.
\verse On that day,’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts, ‘you will invite \textit{one another} under \textit{the} vine and under \textit{the} fig tree.’ ”

\verseWithHeading{Zechariah’s Fifth Vision} And the angel \textit{who was} talking with me returned, and he wakened me as one who is wakened from his sleep.
\verse And he said to me, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see, and look, \textit{a lampstand all of gold}, and a bowl \textit{was} on its top, and its seven lamps on it, and seven lips on \textit{each of} the lamps that \textit{are} on its top.
\verse And \textit{there are} two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”

\verse “The hands of Zerubbabel have founded this house, and his hands will finish it. And you will know that Adonai of hosts has sent me to you.
\verse For whoever has despised the day of small \textit{things} will rejoice and will see the \textit{plumb line} in the hand of Zerubbabel.”
\verse These seven \textit{are} the eyes of Adonai which \textit{are} ranging \textit{throughout the whole earth}.
\verse And I answered and said to him, “What \textit{are} these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?”
\verse And I replied a second \textit{time} and asked him, “What \textit{are} these two twigs of olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?”
\verse And he replied to me, “Do you not know what these \textit{are}?” And I said, “No, my lord.”

\verse And he said to me, “This \textit{is} the curse going out over the surface of the whole earth. For everyone who steals has gone unpunished according to it, and \textit{likewise} everyone who swears \textit{falsely} has gone unpunished according to it.
\verse ‘I have sent it out,’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts, ‘and it will go into the house of the thief and into the house of the one swearing \textit{falsely by my name}, and it will spend the night in that house and will destroy it, with its timber and its stone.’ ”

\verse And he said, “This \textit{is} Wickedness!” And he thrust her \textit{back down} into the basket, and threw the lead cover on top of it.
\verse And I \textit{looked up} and saw, and look!—two women coming forward, and \textit{the} wind \textit{was} in their wings, and they had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between the earth and the sky.
\verse And I asked the angel who was talking to me, “Where \textit{are} they taking the basket?”

\verseWithHeading{Zechariah’s Eighth Vision} \textit{I looked up again}, and I saw, and look!—four chariots coming out from between two mountains, and the mountains \textit{were} mountains of bronze.
\verse With the first chariot \textit{there were} red horses, and with the second chariot \textit{there were} black horses.
\verse And with the third chariot \textit{there were} white horses, and with the fourth chariot \textit{there were} strong dappled horses.

\verse \textit{The one with} the black horses \textit{is} going out to \textit{the} north country, and the white \textit{horses} go after them, while the dappled \textit{ones} go to the south country.”
\verse When the strong \textit{horses} went out, they were anxious to go to patrol the earth. And he said, “Go, patrol the earth.” And they patrolled the earth.
\verse And he cried out to me and said to me, “See those going out to \textit{the} north country have set my spirit at rest in the north country.”
\verseWithHeading{The Branch is Crowned} And the word of Adonai came to me, saying,

\verse Take \textit{the} silver and gold and make a crown, and set \textit{it} on the head of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest.

\verse \textit{And then}, in the fourth year of King Darius, the word of Adonai came to Zechariah on \textit{the} fourth \textit{day} of the ninth month, \textit{which is} Kislev.
\verse And \textit{the people of} Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem-Melech, and their men, to entreat \textit{the favor} of Adonai,
\verse saying to the \textit{priests of the house of Adonai of hosts} and to the prophets, “Should I mourn in the fifth month and keep myself separate as I have done for these many years?”
\verse And the word of Adonai of hosts came to me, saying,
\verse “Say to all the people of the land and to the priests: ‘When you fasted and lamented in the fifth and seventh months for these seventy years, did you really fast for me?
\verse And when you eat and drink, are you not eating and drinking \textit{for yourselves}?
\verse \textit{Are} not \textit{these} the words that Adonai proclaimed \textit{through} the former prophets, when Jerusalem and \textit{its surrounding towns} were inhabited and at ease, and the Negev and the Shephelah were inhabited?’ ”
\verse And the word of Adonai came to Zechariah, saying,
\verse “Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘Judge \textit{with} trustworthy justice, and show steadfast love and compassion \textit{to one another}.
\verse You must not oppress \textit{the} widow, \textit{the} orphan, \textit{the} foreigner, and \textit{the} needy. You must not devise evil in your heart \textit{against one another}.’
\verse But they refused to listen, and turned a stubborn shoulder and \textit{stopped their ears from listening}.
\verse \textit{They made their hearts adamant} in order not to hear the law and the words that Adonai of hosts had sent by his spirit through the former prophets; \textit{therefore} great wrath came from Adonai of hosts.
\verse ‘Thus, just as I called and they would not hear, so they will call and I will not hear,’ says Adonai of hosts.
\verse ‘And I scattered them with a wind among all the nations that they had not known; the land was made desolate behind them— no one crossing through \textit{it} or returning—and they made the desirable land a desolation.’ ”

\verseWithHeading{Adonai’s Promise to Jerusalem} And the word of Adonai of hosts came, saying,
\verse “Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘\textit{I am exceedingly jealous for Zion}; I am jealous for it \textit{with} great wrath.’
\verse Thus says Adonai: ‘I have returned to Zion, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem will be called the faithful city, and the mountain of Adonai of hosts \textit{will be called} the holy mountain.’
\verse Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘Old men and old women shall again sit in the public squares of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand \textit{because of great age}.
\verse And the public squares of the city will be filled \textit{with} boys and girls playing in its public squares.’
\verse Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘\textit{Even} if it seems impossible \textit{to the remnant} of this people in those days, should it also seem impossible \textit{to me}?’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts.
\verse Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘Look! I \textit{am} going to save my people from the land of the east, and from the land of the west,
\verse and I will bring them and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. They will be my people and I will be their God in faithfulness and in righteousness.’
\verse “Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘Let your hands be strong, you who are hearing in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets who \textit{were present} on \textit{the} day \textit{the foundation was laid for the rebuilding of the temple, the house of Adonai of hosts}.
\verse For before those days there was no wage for people or for animals, and there was no safety from the enemy for those who went out or those who came in, and I sent each person against \textit{one another}.
\verse But now \textit{I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days},’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts.
\verse ‘For \textit{there will be} a sowing of peace; the vine will give its fruit, and the soil will give its produce, and the heavens will give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these \textit{things}.
\verse \textit{And then}, just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you will be a blessing. You must not be afraid; let your hands be strong!’ ”
\verse For thus says Adonai of hosts: “Just as I planned to bring disaster on you when your ancestors provoked me to anger,” says Adonai of hosts, “and I did not regret \textit{it},
\verse \textit{so again I have planned} in these days to do good to Jerusalem and the house of Judah. Do not be afraid!
\verse These \textit{are} the things that you must do: speak truth, each \textit{of you}, with his neighbor; practice trustworthy judgment and peace in your gates.
\verse Do not devise evil in your hearts \textit{against} your neighbor, and do not love \textit{a false oath}, because all these \textit{are} things I hate,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse And the word of Adonai of hosts came to me, saying
\verse “Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘The fast of the fourth \textit{month}, the fifth \textit{month}, the seventh \textit{month}, and the tenth \textit{month} will be for the house of Judah jubilation and joy and merry festivals; therefore love truth and peace.’
\verse Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘\textit{It will happen} again that nations and the inhabitants of many cities will come.
\verse And the inhabitants of one city will go to another \textit{city}, saying, “Let us go immediately to entreat \textit{the favor of} Adonai, to seek Adonai of hosts—I also will go!”
\verse And many peoples and powerful nations will come to seek Adonai of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat \textit{the favor of} Adonai.’
\verse Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘In those days ten men from \textit{all the nations of every language} will take hold of the hem of a Judean man, saying, “Let us go with you, for we have heard \textit{that} God \textit{is} with you!” ’ ”

\verse An oracle. The word of Adonai \textit{is} against the land of Hadrach,
\verse and Damascus \textit{is} its resting place. 
For to Adonai belongs the eye of humankind, 
and all the tribes of Israel,
\verse and also Hamath, \textit{which} borders on it; 
Tyre and Sidon—yes, they are very wise!
\verse Tyre has built a fortification for itself, 
and it heaped up silver like dust, 
and gold like \textit{the} mud of \textit{the} streets.
\verse Look! The Lord will drive it out 
and will hurl its outer ramparts into the sea, 
and it will be consumed by fire.
\verse Ashkelon will see and will be afraid, 
and Gaza will writhe exceedingly, 
and Ekron \textit{also}, because its hope is ruined. 
And the king from Gaza will perish, 
and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.
\verse A mongrel people will dwell in Ashdod, 
and I will cut down the pride of \textit{the} Philistines.
\verse I will remove its blood from its mouth, 
and its abominations from between its teeth. 
And it too will be a remnant for our God; 
and it will be like a tribal chief in Judah, 
and Ekron \textit{will be} like \textit{the} Jebusite.
\verse But I will encamp at my temple \textit{like a} guard, 
against those crossing through and returning; 
no oppressor will cross through them again, 
for now I have seen with my \textit{own} eyes.
\verse Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! 
Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! 
Look! Your king comes to you; 
he \textit{is} righteous and victorious, 
humble and riding on a donkey, 
and on a male donkey, \textit{the foal of} a female donkey!
\verse And I will cut off \textit{the} chariot from Ephraim, 
and \textit{the} horse from Jerusalem; 
the battle bow will be cut down, 
and he will announce peace to the nations. 
His dominion \textit{will be} from sea to sea, 
and from \textit{the} River to \textit{the} ends of \textit{the} earth.
\verse \textit{As for} you also, because of the blood of your covenant, 
I will release your prisoners from \textit{the waterless pit}.
\verse Return to \textit{the} fortress, 
O prisoners of hope; 
today \textit{I am} declaring \textit{that} I will repay you double.
\verse For I have bent Judah \textit{as} my bow; 
I have set Ephraim \textit{as an arrow}. 
I will set in motion your sons, O Zion, 
against your sons, O Javan. 
I will wield you like the sword of a warrior.
\verse Then Adonai will appear over them, 
and his arrow will go forth like lightning; 
and my Lord Adonai will blow the trumpet, 
and he shall go out in the storm winds of \textit{the} south.
\verse Adonai of hosts will defend them, 
and they will devour and subdue the slingstones; 
they will drink, they will make noise like wine, 
and they will be full like the sacrificial basin, 
\textit{drenched} like the corners of an altar.
\verse And Adonai their God will save them on that day, 
as the flock of his people; 
for \textit{they are like} the stones of a diadem, 
glittering on his land.

\verseWithHeading{Adonai Gives Rain} Ask rain from Adonai in the season of \textit{the} spring rain—
\verse Adonai, who makes storm clouds, 
and he gives showers of rain to them, 
to everyone vegetation in the field.
\verse Because the household gods speak deceit, 
and those who practice divination see a lie, 
and the dreamers of vanity speak in vain. 
Therefore \textit{the people} wander like sheep; 
they are afflicted because there is no shepherd.
\verse \textit{My anger burns} against the shepherds, 
and I will punish the leaders, 
because Adonai of hosts watches over his flock, 
the house of Judah; 
and he will make them like his majestic horse in war.
\verse From them \textit{the} cornerstone will go out, 
from them \textit{the} tent peg, 
from them \textit{the} battle bow, 
from them every ruler, 
\textit{all} together.
\verse And they will be like warriors, 
trampling in the mud of \textit{the} streets in the battle. 
They will fight, because Adonai \textit{is} with them, 
and they will put to shame \textit{the} riders on horses.
\verse And I will strengthen the house of Judah, 
and the house of Joseph I will save. 
And I will bring them back, because I have compassion on them, 
and they will be as if I had not rejected them, 
for I \textit{am} Adonai their God, and I will answer them.
\verse And \textit{the people of} Ephraim will be like \textit{a} warrior, 
and their heart will be glad as \textit{with} wine. 
And their children will see and rejoice; 
their heart will shout in exultation in Adonai.
\verse I will whistle to them and gather them, 
for I have redeemed them, 
and they will become numerous as they have been numerous \textit{before}.
\verse Though I sow them among the nations, 
in the distant places they will remember me, 
and they will stay alive with their children, and they will return.
\verse And I will bring them back from the land of Egypt, 
and from Assyria I will gather them. 
To the land of Gilead and Lebanon I will bring them, 
until no \textit{room} will be found for them \textit{there}.
\verse And he will pass through the sea of distress, 
and he will strike the waves of the sea, 
and all \textit{the} depths of the Nile will dry up. 
The pride of Assyria will be brought low, 
and the scepter of Egypt will depart.

Wail, oaks of Bashan,

\verseWithHeading{The Two Shepherds} Thus says Adonai my God: “Shepherd the flock \textit{doomed} to slaughter.
\verse The ones buying them kill them and go unpunished, and the ones selling them say, ‘Blessed \textit{be} Adonai, for I have become rich.’ Their own shepherds have no compassion for them.
\verse For I will no longer have compassion on the inhabitants of the land,” \textit{declares} Adonai. “Look, I \textit{am} going to cause humankind to fall, each into the hand of his neighbor, and into the hand of his king; and they will devastate the land, and I will not deliver \textit{anyone} from their hand.”
\verse And I shepherded the flock \textit{doomed} to slaughter, even the afflicted of the flock. I took two staffs, one I called Kindness, and the other I called Unity, and I shepherded the flock.
\verse And I got rid of three shepherds in one month, for \textit{I grew impatient} with them, and \textit{they also became tired of me}.
\verse So I said, “I will not shepherd you! The \textit{one} dying will die, and the \textit{one} to be destroyed will be destroyed. And the \textit{ones} remaining, let them devour \textit{the flesh of each other}.”
\verse And I took my staff Kindness and broke it, to break my covenant that I \textit{had made} with all the peoples.
\verse And it was broken on that day. Then the afflicted of the flock, the \textit{ones who were} watching me, knew that it \textit{was} the word of Adonai.
\verse And I said to them, “If \textit{it seems right to you}, give \textit{me} my wages, but if not, \textit{keep them}.” And they weighed out my wages, thirty silver \textit{shekels}.
\verse And Adonai said to me, “Throw it to the potter,” \textit{this noble price} \textit{at} which I was valued by them!” So I took the thirty silver \textit{shekels} and I threw them to the potter \textit{in} the house of Adonai.
\verse Then I broke my second staff Unity to break the family ties between Judah and Israel.
\verse And Adonai said to me, “Take again the implements of a foolish shepherd.
\verse For look, I \textit{am} raising up a shepherd in the land who will not attend to the \textit{ones that are} perishing; he will not seek the young man, he will not heal the \textit{ones that are} crushed and he will not sustain the healthy \textit{ones}; he will devour the flesh of the \textit{fattened ones} and tear apart \textit{even} their hoofs.
\verse “Woe, my worthless shepherd 
who deserts the flock! 
\textit{May} a sword \textit{fall} on his arm 
and on \textit{his right eye}! 
May his arm wither completely 
and \textit{his right eye} be utterly blinded!”

\verse ‘Look, I \textit{am} going to make Jerusalem a cup of reeling for all the surrounding nations; it will also be against Judah in the siege against Jerusalem.
\verse \textit{And then} on that day I will make Jerusalem a stone weight for all the peoples. All those lifting it up will grievously hurt themselves, and all the nations of the earth will assemble against it.
\verse On that day,’ \textit{declares} Adonai, ‘I will strike every horse with confusion, and the one riding it with madness; but over the house of Judah \textit{I will keep my eyes open}, and I will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.
\verse And the clans of Judah will say \textit{to themselves}, “The inhabitants of Jerusalem are a strength to us, through Adonai of hosts, their God.”
\verse “ ‘On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a pan of fire among \textit{sticks of} wood, and like a torch of fire among stalks of grain, and they will devour to \textit{the} right and to \textit{the} left all the surrounding peoples, and Jerusalem will be inhabited again \textit{in} its place, in Jerusalem.
\verse And Adonai will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be exalted over Judah.
\verse On that day Adonai will put a shield around the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who stumbles among them on that day will be like David, and the house of David \textit{will be} like God, like the angel of Adonai, \textit{before them}.
\verse \textit{And then} on that day I will seek to destroy all the nations coming against Jerusalem.
\verse “ ‘I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication, and they will look to me whom they pierced, and they shall mourn over him, as one wails over an only child, and they will grieve bitterly over him as \textit{one} grieves bitterly over a firstborn.
\verse On that day the wailing will be great in Jerusalem, like the wailing for Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
\verse And the land shall mourn, \textit{each clan by itself}; the clan of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the clan of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;
\verse the clan of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the clan of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves;
\verse and all those clans remaining, \textit{each clan by itself}, and their wives by themselves.’ ”

\verse “ ‘On that day a well will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, \textit{to cleanse them from sin and from impurity}.
\verse \textit{And then}, on that day,’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts, ‘I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and also the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness I will banish from the land.
\verse \textit{And then}, if anyone prophesies again, his father and his mother who bore him will say to him, “You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of Adonai!” And his father and his mother who bore him will pierce him through when he prophesies.
\verse \textit{And then} on that day, each of the prophets will be ashamed because of his vision when he was prophesying, and they will not put on a cloak of hair in order to deceive,
\verse but he will say, “I \textit{am} not a prophet; I am a tiller of the soil, for a man has acquired me since my youth.”
\verse And someone shall say to him, “What \textit{are} these wounds \textit{between your arms}?” and he will say, “Those I have received \textit{in} the house of \textit{the ones who} love me.” ’ ”
\verseWithHeading{The Sword Shall Strike the Shepherd} “O sword, awake against my shepherd, 
against \textit{the} man \textit{who is} my associate,” 
\textit{declares} Adonai of hosts. 
“Strike the shepherd, 
so that the sheep may be scattered, 
and I will turn my hand against the small \textit{ones}.
\verse \textit{And then} in all the land,” \textit{declares} Adonai, 
“\textit{two thirds} will be cut off and perish, 
and one third will be left alive in it.
\verse And I will bring the \textit{remaining} third into the fire, 
and I will refine them like \textit{one} refines silver, 
and I will test them like \textit{one} tests gold. 
They will call my name, 
and I will answer them. 
I will say, ‘They are my people,’ 
and they will say, ‘Adonai \textit{is} my God.’ ”

\verseWithHeading{Zechariah’s Apocalyptic Vision} Look! A day \textit{is} coming for Adonai, when your plunder will be divided in your midst.
\verse I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, and they will loot the houses, and the women will be raped; half of the city will go into exile, but the remainder of the people will not be cut off from the city.
\verse Then Adonai will go forth and fight against those nations, like \textit{when he fights} on a day of battle.
\verse On that day his feet will stand on \textit{the Mount of Olives}, which faces Jerusalem on \textit{the} east; and \textit{the Mount of Olives} will be split \textit{in half}, from east to west, \textit{by} a very great valley; and half of the mountain will withdraw toward the north, and the other half toward the south.
\verse And you will flee \textit{by} the valley of my mountains, because the valley of \textit{the} mountains will reach to Azal, and you will flee like you fled from the earthquake in the days of King Uzziah of Judah. And Adonai my God will come, \textit{and} all \textit{the} holy ones with him.
\verse \textit{And then} on that day there will not be light, the precious things will congeal.
\verse There shall be continuous day—it is known to Adonai—not day and not night; and at evening time there will be light.
\verse \textit{And then} on that day, living waters will flow out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea, and the other half to the western sea; it will happen \textit{both} in the summer and in the winter.
\verse And Adonai will be king over all the earth; on that day Adonai will be one and his name one.
\verse All the land will be transformed into a desert plateau from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. But it will rise up high and it will stay in its place from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of \textit{the} former gate, up to the Corner Gate and from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s winepresses.
\verse And they will dwell in it, and \textit{there will be no more ban imposed}, and Jerusalem will dwell in security.
\verse And this will be the plague \textit{with} which Adonai will strike all the peoples that fight against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they \textit{are} standing on their feet; their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
\verse \textit{And then} on that day a great panic from Adonai will fall on them, and \textit{they will seize one another’s hand}, and the hand of the one will be raised against the hand of \textit{another}.
\verse And Judah also will fight at Jerusalem. And the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected—gold and silver, and garments \textit{in great abundance}.
\verse \textit{Like this plague} will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, and the donkey, and every kind of animal in those camps.
\verse \textit{And then} every survivor from all those nations coming against Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship \textit{the} king, Adonai of hosts, and celebrate the Feast of Booths.
\verse \textit{And then} whoever of the clans of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the king, Adonai of hosts, it will not rain on them.
\verse And if the clan of Egypt will not go up and come in, on them will be that plague Adonai inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
\verse This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
\verse On that day there will be \textit{inscribed} on the bells of the horses, “Holy to Adonai.” And the cooking pots in the house of Adonai will be \textit{holy} like the sacrificial basins before the altar.
\verse And every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Adonai of hosts, and all those who sacrifice will come and will take from them, and will cook in them, and there will be no longer a \textit{trader} in the house of Adonai of hosts on that day.
