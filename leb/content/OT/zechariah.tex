\verse In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Adonai came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, son of Iddo, saying,
\verse “Adonai \textit{was very angry with your ancestors}.
\verse You must say to them: ‘Thus says Adonai of hosts: “Return to me,” \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts, “and I will return to you,” says Adonai of hosts.
\verse “Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, ‘Thus says Adonai of hosts: “Return from your evil ways and your evil deeds!” ’ But they did not hear and they did not pay attention to me,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “Your ancestors, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?
\verse However, did not my words and my regulations which I commanded my servants the prophets overtake your ancestors? And they repented and said, ‘Adonai of hosts planned to do with us according to our ways, and according to our deeds so he has dealt with us.’ ” ’ ”
\verseWithHeading{Zechariah’s First Vision} On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of Adonai came to Zechariah the prophet, son of Berekiah, son of Iddo, saying,
\verse \textit{I had a vision in the night}, and look, a man riding on a red horse. And he was standing between the myrtle shrubs that were in the ravine, and behind him were red, reddish-brown, and white horses.
\verse And I asked, “What are these, my lord?” And the angel who was talking with me said, “I will show you what these are.”
\verse And the man standing between the myrtle shrubs answered and said, “These are those whom Adonai has sent to patrol the earth.”
\verse And they answered the angel of Adonai who was standing between the myrtle shrubs, and they said, “We have patrolled the earth, and look, all the earth \textit{is dwelling in peace}.”
\verse The angel of Adonai answered and said, “O Adonai of hosts, \textit{how long} will you have no compassion on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which you showed fury these seventy years?”
\verse With gracious and comforting words Adonai answered the angel who was talking with me.
\verse And the angel who was talking with me said to me, “Proclaim, saying, ‘Thus says Adonai of hosts: “\textit{I am very jealous} for Jerusalem and for Zion!
\verse And \textit{I am extremely angry} with the nations that are at ease, for while I was a little angry, they \textit{furthered disaster}.”
\verse Therefore, thus says Adonai: “I have returned to Jerusalem with compassion. My temple will be built in it,” \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts, “and a measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.” ’
\verse Proclaim again, saying, ‘Thus says Adonai of hosts: “My cities shall again overflow from prosperity, and Adonai will comfort Zion again, and he will choose Jerusalem again.” ’ ”
\verseWithHeading{Zechariah’s Second Vision}  And I \textit{looked up} and I saw, and look, there were four horns!
\verse And I said to the angel who was talking with me, “What are these?” And he said to me, “These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
\verse Then Adonai showed me four skilled craftsmen,
\verse and I asked, “What are these coming to do?” And he answered, saying, “These are the horns that scattered Judah, \textit{so that no man} lifted up his head; but these have come to frighten them, to strike down the horns of the nations that lifted a horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.”

\verseWithHeading{Zechariah’s Third Vision} And I \textit{looked up} and I saw, and look, a man, and in his hand was a measuring rope!
\verse And I asked, “Where are you going?” And he answered me, “To measure Jerusalem to see what is its width and what is its length.”
\verse And look, the angel who was talking to me was coming forward, and another angel was coming forward to meet him.
\verse And he said to him, “Run, say to that young man, ‘Jerusalem shall be inhabited \textit{like villages without walls} because of the multitude of people and animals in its midst.
\verse And I will be for it a wall of fire all around,’ \textit{declares} Adonai, ‘and I will be the glory in its midst.’ ”

\verse “Woe, Zion! Escape, you inhabitants of the daughter of Babylon!”
\verse For thus said Adonai of hosts, after glory he sent me against the nations plundering you: Truly, the one touching you is touching the apple of his eye.
\verse “Yes, look! I am going to wave my hand against them, and they will become plunder for their servants, and you will know that Adonai of hosts has sent me.
\verse Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for look, I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “Many nations will join themselves to Adonai on that day, and they will be my people, and I will dwell in your midst. And you will know that Adonai of hosts has sent me to you.
\verse And Adonai will inherit Judah as his portion \textit{in the holy land}, and he will again choose Jerusalem.

\verse But Adonai said to Satan, “Adonai rebukes you, O Satan! Adonai who has chosen Jerusalem rebukes you! Is this not a stick snatched from the fire?”
\verse And Joshua was clothed in filthy garments and was standing \textit{before} the angel.
\verse And he answered and said to the ones standing \textit{before} him, saying, “Remove the filthy garments from him.” And he said to him, “See, I have taken away your guilt from you, and will clothe you with rich garments.”
\verse And I said, “Let them put a clean headband on his head.” And they put a clean headband on his head, and they clothed him with garments. And the angel of Adonai was standing by.
\verse And the angel of Adonai assured Joshua, saying,
\verse “Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my requirements, then you will judge my house, and you will also guard my courtyards, and I will give to you passageways among these that are standing here.
\verse Listen, please, O Joshua the high priest, you and your companions that are sitting \textit{before} you. For the men are a sign that, look, I am going to bring my servant the Branch.
\verse For consider, the stone that \textit{I set before} Joshua, on one stone are seven eyes. Look, \textit{I am going to engrave an inscription on it},’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts, ‘and I will remove the guilt of that land in a single day.
\verse On that day,’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts, ‘you will invite \textit{one another} under the vine and under the fig tree.’ ”

\verse And he said to me, “This is the curse going out over the surface of the whole earth. For everyone who steals has gone unpunished according to it, and likewise everyone who swears falsely has gone unpunished according to it.
\verse ‘I have sent it out,’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts, ‘and it will go into the house of the thief and into the house of the one swearing \textit{falsely by my name}, and it will spend the night in that house and will destroy it, with its timber and its stone.’ ”

\verse \textit{And then}, in the fourth year of King Darius, the word of Adonai came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Kislev.
\verse And the people of Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem-Melech, and their men, to entreat \textit{the favor} of Adonai,
\verse saying to the \textit{priests of the house of Adonai of hosts} and to the prophets, “Should I mourn in the fifth month and keep myself separate as I have done for these many years?”
\verse And the word of Adonai of hosts came to me, saying,
\verse “Say to all the people of the land and to the priests: ‘When you fasted and lamented in the fifth and seventh months for these seventy years, did you really fast for me?
\verse And when you eat and drink, are you not eating and drinking for yourselves?
\verse Are not these the words that Adonai proclaimed \textit{through} the former prophets, when Jerusalem and \textit{its surrounding towns} were inhabited and at ease, and the Negev and the Shephelah were inhabited?’ ”
\verse And the word of Adonai came to Zechariah, saying,
\verse “Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘Judge with trustworthy justice, and show steadfast love and compassion \textit{to one another}.
\verse You must not oppress the widow, the orphan, the foreigner, and the needy. You must not devise evil in your heart \textit{against one another}.’
\verse But they refused to listen, and turned a stubborn shoulder and \textit{stopped their ears from listening}.
\verse \textit{They made their hearts adamant} in order not to hear the law and the words that Adonai of hosts had sent by his spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from Adonai of hosts.
\verse ‘Thus, just as I called and they would not hear, so they will call and I will not hear,’ says Adonai of hosts.
\verse ‘And I scattered them with a wind among all the nations that they had not known; the land was made desolate behind them— no one crossing through it or returning—and they made the desirable land a desolation.’ ”

\verseWithHeading{Adonai’s Promise to Jerusalem} And the word of Adonai of hosts came, saying,

\verse Thus says Adonai: ‘I have returned to Zion, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem will be called the faithful city, and the mountain of Adonai of hosts will be called the holy mountain.’
\verse Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘Old men and old women shall again sit in the public squares of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand \textit{because of great age}.
\verse And the public squares of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its public squares.’
\verse Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘Even if it seems impossible \textit{to the remnant} of this people in those days, should it also seem impossible \textit{to me}?’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts.
\verse Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘Look! I am going to save my people from the land of the east, and from the land of the west,
\verse and I will bring them and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. They will be my people and I will be their God in faithfulness and in righteousness.’
\verse “Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘Let your hands be strong, you who are hearing in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets who were present on the day \textit{the foundation was laid for the rebuilding of the temple, the house of Adonai of hosts}.
\verse For before those days there was no wage for people or for animals, and there was no safety from the enemy for those who went out or those who came in, and I sent each person against \textit{one another}.
\verse But now \textit{I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days},’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts.
\verse ‘For there will be a sowing of peace; the vine will give its fruit, and the soil will give its produce, and the heavens will give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.
\verse \textit{And then}, just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you will be a blessing. You must not be afraid; let your hands be strong!’ ”
\verse For thus says Adonai of hosts: “Just as I planned to bring disaster on you when your ancestors provoked me to anger,” says Adonai of hosts, “and I did not regret it,
\verse \textit{so again I have planned} in these days to do good to Jerusalem and the house of Judah. Do not be afraid!
\verse These are the things that you must do: speak truth, each of you, with his neighbor; practice trustworthy judgment and peace in your gates.
\verse Do not devise evil in your hearts against your neighbor, and do not love \textit{a false oath}, because all these are things I hate,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse And the word of Adonai of hosts came to me, saying
\verse “Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘The fast of the fourth month, the fifth month, the seventh month, and the tenth month will be for the house of Judah jubilation and joy and merry festivals; therefore love truth and peace.’
\verse Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘It will happen again that nations and the inhabitants of many cities will come.
\verse And the inhabitants of one city will go to another city, saying, “Let us go immediately to entreat \textit{the favor of} Adonai, to seek Adonai of hosts—I also will go!”
\verse And many peoples and powerful nations will come to seek Adonai of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat \textit{the favor of} Adonai.’

\verse An oracle. The word of Adonai is against the land of Hadrach,
\verse and Damascus is its resting place. 
For to Adonai belongs the eye of humankind, 
and all the tribes of Israel,
\verse and also Hamath, which borders on it; 
Tyre and Sidon—yes, they are very wise!
\verse Tyre has built a fortification for itself, 
and it heaped up silver like dust, 
and gold like the mud of the streets.
\verse Look! The Lord will drive it out 
and will hurl its outer ramparts into the sea, 
and it will be consumed by fire.
\verse Ashkelon will see and will be afraid, 
and Gaza will writhe exceedingly, 
and Ekron also, because its hope is ruined. 
And the king from Gaza will perish, 
and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.
\verse A mongrel people will dwell in Ashdod, 
and I will cut down the pride of the Philistines.
\verse I will remove its blood from its mouth, 
and its abominations from between its teeth. 
And it too will be a remnant for our God; 
and it will be like a tribal chief in Judah, 
and Ekron will be like the Jebusite.
\verse But I will encamp at my temple like a guard, 
against those crossing through and returning; 
no oppressor will cross through them again, 
for now I have seen with my own eyes.
\verse Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! 
Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! 
Look! Your king comes to you; 
he is righteous and victorious, 
humble and riding on a donkey, 
and on a male donkey, \textit{the foal of} a female donkey!
\verse And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, 
and the horse from Jerusalem; 
the battle bow will be cut down, 
and he will announce peace to the nations. 
His dominion will be from sea to sea, 
and from the River to the ends of the earth.
\verse As for you also, because of the blood of your covenant, 
I will release your prisoners from \textit{the waterless pit}.
\verse Return to the fortress, 
O prisoners of hope; 
today I am declaring that I will repay you double.
\verse For I have bent Judah as my bow; 
I have set Ephraim as an arrow. 
I will set in motion your sons, O Zion, 
against your sons, O Javan. 
I will wield you like the sword of a warrior.
\verse Then Adonai will appear over them, 
and his arrow will go forth like lightning; 
and my Lord Adonai will blow the trumpet, 
and he shall go out in the storm winds of the south.
\verse Adonai of hosts will defend them, 
and they will devour and subdue the slingstones; 
they will drink, they will make noise like wine, 
and they will be full like the sacrificial basin, 
drenched like the corners of an altar.
\verse And Adonai their God will save them on that day, 
as the flock of his people;

and the dreamers of vanity speak in vain. 
Therefore the people wander like sheep;

from them the tent peg, 
from them the battle bow,

all together.
\verse And they will be like warriors, 
trampling in the mud of the streets in the battle. 
They will fight, because Adonai is with them,

\verse And I will strengthen the house of Judah, 
and the house of Joseph I will save. 
And I will bring them back, because I have compassion on them, 
and they will be as if I had not rejected them, 
for I am Adonai their God, and I will answer them.
\verse And the people of Ephraim will be like a warrior, 
and their heart will be glad as with wine. 
And their children will see and rejoice; 
their heart will shout in exultation in Adonai.
\verse I will whistle to them and gather them, 
for I have redeemed them, 
and they will become numerous as they have been numerous before.
\verse Though I sow them among the nations, 
in the distant places they will remember me, 
and they will stay alive with their children, and they will return.
\verse And I will bring them back from the land of Egypt, 
and from Assyria I will gather them. 
To the land of Gilead and Lebanon I will bring them, 
until no room will be found for them there.
\verse And he will pass through the sea of distress,

and all the depths of the Nile will dry up.

\verseWithHeading{The Two Shepherds} Thus says Adonai my God: “Shepherd the flock doomed to slaughter.
\verse The ones buying them kill them and go unpunished, and the ones selling them say, ‘Blessed be Adonai, for I have become rich.’ Their own shepherds have no compassion for them.
\verse For I will no longer have compassion on the inhabitants of the land,” \textit{declares} Adonai. “Look, I am going to cause humankind to fall, each into the hand of his neighbor, and into the hand of his king; and they will devastate the land, and I will not deliver anyone from their hand.”
\verse And I shepherded the flock doomed to slaughter, even the afflicted of the flock. I took two staffs, one I called Kindness, and the other I called Unity, and I shepherded the flock.
\verse And I got rid of three shepherds in one month, for \textit{I grew impatient} with them, and \textit{they also became tired of me}.
\verse So I said, “I will not shepherd you! The one dying will die, and the one to be destroyed will be destroyed. And the ones remaining, let them devour \textit{the flesh of each other}.”
\verse And I took my staff Kindness and broke it, to break my covenant that I \textit{had made} with all the peoples.
\verse And it was broken on that day. Then the afflicted of the flock, the ones who were watching me, knew that it was the word of Adonai.
\verse And I said to them, “If \textit{it seems right to you}, give me my wages, but if not, \textit{keep them}.” And they weighed out my wages, thirty silver shekels.
\verse And Adonai said to me, “Throw it to the potter,” \textit{this noble price} at which I was valued by them!” So I took the thirty silver shekels and I threw them to the potter in the house of Adonai.
\verse Then I broke my second staff Unity to break the family ties between Judah and Israel.
\verse And Adonai said to me, “Take again the implements of a foolish shepherd.
\verse For look, I am raising up a shepherd in the land who will not attend to the ones that are perishing; he will not seek the young man, he will not heal the ones that are crushed and he will not sustain the healthy ones; he will devour the flesh of the \textit{fattened ones} and tear apart even their hoofs.

\verse ‘Look, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup of reeling for all the surrounding nations; it will also be against Judah in the siege against Jerusalem.
\verse \textit{And then} on that day I will make Jerusalem a stone weight for all the peoples. All those lifting it up will grievously hurt themselves, and all the nations of the earth will assemble against it.

\verse On that day Adonai will put a shield around the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who stumbles among them on that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of Adonai, \textit{before them}.
\verse \textit{And then} on that day I will seek to destroy all the nations coming against Jerusalem.
\verse “ ‘I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication, and they will look to me whom they pierced, and they shall mourn over him, as one wails over an only child, and they will grieve bitterly over him as one grieves bitterly over a firstborn.
\verse On that day the wailing will be great in Jerusalem, like the wailing for Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
\verse And the land shall mourn, \textit{each clan by itself}; the clan of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the clan of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;

“Strike the shepherd, 
so that the sheep may be scattered, 
and I will turn my hand against the small ones.
\verse \textit{And then} in all the land,” \textit{declares} Adonai, 
“\textit{two thirds} will be cut off and perish, 
and one third will be left alive in it.
\verse And I will bring the remaining third into the fire, 
and I will refine them like one refines silver, 
and I will test them like one tests gold. 
They will call my name, 
and I will answer them. 
I will say, ‘They are my people,’ 
and they will say, ‘Adonai is my God.’ ”

\begin{biblechapter} % Zechariah 14
\verseWithHeading{Zechariah’s Apocalyptic Vision} Look! A day is coming for Adonai, when your plunder will be divided in your midst.
\verse I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, and they will loot the houses, and the women will be raped; half of the city will go into exile, but the remainder of the people will not be cut off from the city.
\verse Then Adonai will go forth and fight against those nations, like \textit{when he fights} on a day of battle.
\verse On that day his feet will stand on \textit{the Mount of Olives}, which faces Jerusalem on the east; and \textit{the Mount of Olives} will be split \textit{in half}, from east to west, by a very great valley; and half of the mountain will withdraw toward the north, and the other half toward the south.
\verse And you will flee by the valley of my mountains, because the valley of the mountains will reach to Azal, and you will flee like you fled from the earthquake in the days of King Uzziah of Judah. And Adonai my God will come, and all the holy ones with him.
\verse \textit{And then} on that day there will not be light, the precious things will congeal.
\verse There shall be continuous day—it is known to Adonai—not day and not night; and at evening time there will be light.
\verse \textit{And then} on that day, living waters will flow out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea, and the other half to the western sea; it will happen both in the summer and in the winter.
\verse And Adonai will be king over all the earth; on that day Adonai will be one and his name one.
\verse All the land will be transformed into a desert plateau from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. But it will rise up high and it will stay in its place from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the former gate, up to the Corner Gate and from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s winepresses.
\verse And they will dwell in it, and \textit{there will be no more ban imposed}, and Jerusalem will dwell in security.
\verse And this will be the plague with which Adonai will strike all the peoples that fight against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they are standing on their feet; their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
\verse \textit{And then} on that day a great panic from Adonai will fall on them, and \textit{they will seize one another’s hand}, and the hand of the one will be raised against the hand of \textit{another}.
\verse And Judah also will fight at Jerusalem. And the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected—gold and silver, and garments \textit{in great abundance}.
\verse \textit{Like this plague} will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, and the donkey, and every kind of animal in those camps.
\verse \textit{And then} every survivor from all those nations coming against Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the king, Adonai of hosts, and celebrate the Feast of Booths.
\verse \textit{And then} whoever of the clans of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the king, Adonai of hosts, it will not rain on them.
\verse And if the clan of Egypt will not go up and come in, on them will be that plague Adonai inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
\verse This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
\verse On that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, “Holy to Adonai.” And the cooking pots in the house of Adonai will be holy like the sacrificial basins before the altar.
\verse And every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Adonai of hosts, and all those who sacrifice will come and will take from them, and will cook in them, and there will be no longer a \textit{trader} in the house of Adonai of hosts on that day.
