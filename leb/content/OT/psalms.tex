\begin{biblechapter} % Psalms 1
\verseWithHeading{The Ways of the Righteous and the Wicked} Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of \textit{the} wicked; 
nor does he stand in \textit{the} way of sinners; 
nor does he sit in \textit{the} assembly of mockers.
\verse Instead, in the law of Adonai \textit{is} his delight, 
and on his law he meditates day and night.
\verse And so, he is like a tree planted by streams of water 
that gives its fruit in its season; 
its leaf also does not wither. 
Therefore all that he does prospers.
\verse Not so the wicked. 
Instead, \textit{they are} like the chaff that \textit{the} wind scatters.
\verse Therefore \textit{the} wicked will not stand in the judgment, 
nor sinners in the congregation of \textit{the} righteous;
\verse for Adonai knows \textit{the} way of \textit{the} righteous, 
but \textit{the} way of \textit{the} wicked will perish.

\begin{biblechapter} % Psalms 2
\verseWithHeading{The Messiah’s Reign} Why are nations in tumult, 
and countries plotting in vain?
\verse \textit{The} kings of \textit{the} earth establish themselves, 
and the rulers conspire together 
against Adonai and his anointed:
\verse “Let us tear off their bonds, 
and cast their cords from us!”
\verse \textit{He who} sits \textit{enthroned} in the heavens laughs. 
The Lord derides them.
\verse Then he speaks to them in his wrath, 
and in his fury he terrifies them:
\verse “But as for me, I have set my king 
on Zion, my holy mountain.”
\verse I will tell the decree; 
Adonai said to me: 
“You are my son; 
today I have begotten you.
\verse Ask from me and I will make \textit{the} nations your heritage, 
and your possession \textit{the} ends of \textit{the} earth.
\verse You will break them with an iron rod. 
Like a potter’s vessel you will shatter them.”
\verse So then, O kings, be wise. 
Be warned, O rulers of \textit{the} earth.
\verse Serve Adonai with fear, 
and rejoice with trembling.
\verse Kiss the Son 
lest he be angry and you perish \textit{on the} way, 
for his anger burns quickly. 
Blessed are all \textit{who} take refuge in him.

In \textit{the} morning I will set forth \textit{my case} to you and I will watch.
\verse For you \textit{are} not a God \textit{who} desires wickedness. 
Evil cannot dwell with you.

I will enter your house. 
I will bow down toward \textit{your holy temple} in awe \textit{of} you.
\verse O Adonai, lead me in your righteousness because of my enemies; 
make straight before me your way.
\verse For there is not \textit{anything} reliable in his mouth; 
their inner part \textit{is} destruction. 
Their throat is an open grave; 
\textit{with} their tongue they speak deceit.
\verse Treat them as guilty, O God; 
let them fall because of their plans. 
Because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out, 
for they have rebelled against you.
\verse But let all who take shelter in you rejoice. 
Let them ever sing for joy, 
\textit{because} you spread protection over them;

it grows old because of all my oppressors.

He has bent his bow and he has \textit{strung} it.
\verse And he has prepared for him weapons of death. 
He has made his arrows fiery shafts.
\verse See, he travails with evil. 
He is pregnant with trouble,

on account of your enemies,

I will sing \textit{the praise of} your name, O Most High.
\verse When my enemies turn back,

\verse For you have maintained my just cause; 
you have sat on \textit{the} throne judging correctly.

you have destroyed \textit{the} wicked. 
Their name you have blotted out 
forever and ever.
\verse The enemies are destroyed \textit{in} ruins forever, 
and you have uprooted \textit{their} cities; 
their very memory has perished.

He has established his throne for judgment.

\begin{biblechapter} % Psalms 10
\verseWithHeading{A Prayer for God to Throw down the Wicked} Why, O Adonai, do you stand far off? 
\textit{Why} do you hide during times of distress?
\verse In arrogance \textit{the} wicked persecutes \textit{the} poor. 
Let them be caught in \textit{the} schemes that they devised,
\verse for \textit{the} wicked boasts about the desire of his \textit{heart}, 
and \textit{the} one greedy for gain curses \textit{and} treats Adonai with contempt.
\verse \textit{With bald-faced pride} \textit{the} wicked will not seek \textit{God}. 
There is no God in any of his thoughts.
\verse His ways endure at all times. 
Your judgments are aloof from him. 
\textit{As for} all his enemies, he scoffs at them.
\verse He says in his heart, “I shall not be moved 
\textit{throughout all generations}, \textit{during} which \textit{I will have} no trouble.”
\verse His mouth is filled with cursing, 
with deceits and oppression; 
under his tongue are trouble and evil.
\verse He sits in ambush in villages; 
in the hiding places he kills \textit{the} innocent. 
His eyes \textit{lurk} for \textit{the} helpless.
\verse He lies in ambush \textit{secretly,} like a lion in a thicket. 
He lies in ambush to seize \textit{the} poor; 
he seizes \textit{the} poor by catching him in his net.
\verse He is crushed; he is bowed down; 
so the helpless host falls by his \textit{might}.
\verse He says in his heart, “God has forgotten. 
He has hidden his face. 
He never sees.”
\verse Rise up, O Adonai; 
O God, lift up your hand. 
Do not forget \textit{the} afflicted.
\verse Why does the wicked treat God with contempt? 
He says in his heart, “You will not call \textit{me} to account.”
\verse \textit{But} you have seen; indeed you have noted trouble and grief 
to take \textit{it} into your hand. 
The helpless abandons \textit{himself} upon you; 
you have been \textit{the} helper \textit{for the} orphan.
\verse Break \textit{the} arm of \textit{the} wicked, 
and \textit{as for the} evil \textit{man}— 
seek out his wickedness \textit{until} you find none.
\verse Adonai \textit{is} king forever and ever; 
the nations have perished from his land.

His eyelids see; 
they test \textit{the} children of humankind.
\verse Adonai tests \textit{the} righteous, 
but \textit{the} wicked and \textit{the} lover of violence

\verse He will rain coals on \textit{the} wicked.

who spoke to Adonai the words of this song 
\textit{when} Adonai delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, 
and from the hand of Saul.} And he said: 
“I love you, O Adonai, my strength.”
\verse Adonai \textit{is} my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, 
my God, my rock in whom I have taken refuge, 
my shield and the horn of my deliverance, my stronghold.
\verse I called upon Adonai, who is worthy to be praised, 
and I was saved from my enemies.
\verse The ropes of death encircled me, 
and streams of ruin overwhelmed me.
\verse The ropes of Sheol surrounded me; 
\textit{the} snares of death confronted me.
\verse In my trouble I called on Adonai, 
and to my God I cried for help. 
He heard my voice from his temple, 
and my cry for help 
came up before his presence into his ears.
\verse Then the earth shook and quaked, 
and \textit{the} foundations of \textit{the} mountains trembled, 
and they staggered because he was angry.
\verse Smoke went forth from his nose, 
and fire from his mouth consumed. 
Burning coals blazed from him.
\verse So he bowed \textit{the} heavens and came down 
with a thick cloud under his feet.
\verse And he mounted a cherub and flew, 
and he swooped down on wings of wind.
\verse He made darkness his hiding place; 
all about him his covering 
\textit{was} a darkness of waters, \textit{thick clouds}.
\verse From the brightness before him 
his clouds passed over 
\textit{with} hail and coals of fire.
\verse And Adonai thundered from the heavens, 
and the Most High uttered his voice 
\textit{with} hail and coals of fire.
\verse And he shot his arrows and scattered them, 
and many lightning bolts and routed them.
\verse Then the channels of \textit{the} sea became visible, 
and \textit{the} foundations of \textit{the} world were uncovered 
by your rebuke, O Adonai, 
by the \textit{blast} of the wind of your nose.
\verse He reached from on high; he seized me. 
He drew me from many waters.
\verse He delivered me from my strong enemy, 
and from \textit{those who} hated me 
because they were stronger than I.
\verse They confronted me on the day of disaster, 
but Adonai was my support.
\verse So he brought me out to a spacious place. 
He delivered me because he delighted in me.
\verse Adonai has rewarded me according to my righteousness; 
According to the cleanness of my hands

and with my God I can scale a wall.
\verse This God—his way \textit{is} blameless. 
The word of Adonai \textit{is} flawless. 
He \textit{is} a shield for all those who take refuge in him.
\verse For who \textit{is} God apart from Adonai, 
and who \textit{is} a rock except our God?
\verse The God who girded me \textit{with} strength, 
and made safe my way,
\verse he made my feet like the deer’s, 
and on my high places he makes me stand.
\verse \textit{He} trains my hands for war, 
so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
\verse You also gave me the shield of your salvation, 
and your right hand supported me, 
and your humility made me great.
\verse You enlarged my step under me, 
and my ankles did not slip.
\verse I chased my enemies and overtook them; 
I did not turn back until they were finished \textit{off}.
\verse I struck them and they were not able to stand up; 
they fell under my feet.
\verse And you girded me \textit{with} strength for the battle; 
\textit{those} rising against me you made to kneel under me.
\verse And you \textit{made my enemies turn their backs}, 
then I destroyed those \textit{who} hated me.
\verse They cried out but there was no rescuer, 
\textit{even} to Adonai, but he did not answer them.
\verse And I ground them like dust \textit{in the wind}, 
I emptied them out like mud of \textit{the} streets.
\verse You rescued me from strife with people; 
you set me as head (over) nations. 
People I did not know served me;
\verse as soon as \textit{they heard}, they obeyed me. 
\textit{The} children of a foreign land feigned obedience before me.
\verse \textit{The} children of a foreign land \textit{lost heart}, 
and they came trembling from their strongholds.
\verse Adonai lives, and blessed \textit{be} my rock, 
and may the God of my salvation be exalted—
\verse the God who executed vengeance for me, 
and subdued peoples under me,
\verse who delivered me from my enemies. 
Indeed, you exalted me higher than \textit{those who} rose against me. 
You delivered me from the man of violence.
\verse Therefore I will give thanks to you among the nations, O Adonai, 
and I will sing \textit{the praise} of your name:
\verse the one who makes great victories for his king, 
and \textit{who} shows loyal love for his anointed,

May his name increase \textit{as long as the sun shines}, 
and let them be blessed in him. 
Let all nations call him blessed.

\verse But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled. 
My steps had nearly slipped,

\textit{when} I saw \textit{the} well-being of \textit{the} wicked.
\verse For there are no pains up to their death, 
and their bodies \textit{are} \textit{healthy}.
\verse They do not have \textit{ordinary trouble},

\verse Therefore pride is their necklace; 
an outfit of violence covers them.
\verse Their eye bulges from fat. 
Imaginings overflow \textit{their} heart.
\verse They mock and speak maliciously of oppression; 
they speak \textit{as though} from on high.
\verse They set their mouth against the heavens, 
and their tongue roams the earth.
\verse Therefore his people turn there, 
and abundant waters are slurped up by them.
\verse And they say, “How does God know?” 
and, “Does the Most High have knowledge?”
\verse See, these \textit{are the} wicked, 
and they increase wealth, ever carefree.
\verse Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure, 
and washed my hands in innocence.
\verse And I have been plagued all day 
and rebuked \textit{every morning}.
\verse If I had said, “I will speak thus,” 
behold, I would have acted treacherously 
against your children’s generation.

\textit{Then} I understood their fate.
\verse Surely you set them on slippery places. 
You cause them to fall onto ruin.
\verse How they become a desolation in a moment! 
They come to a complete end by terrors.
\verse Like a dream upon awakening, 
when \textit{you} wake up, O Lord, 
you will despise their fleeting form.
\verse When my heart was embittered 
and I felt stabbed in my kidneys,
\verse then I was brutish and ignorant. 
With you I was \textit{like} the beasts.
\verse But I \textit{am} continually with you; 
you have hold of my right hand.
\verse You will guide me with your advice, 
and afterward you will take me \textit{into} honor.
\verse Whom do I have in the heavens \textit{except you}? 
And with you I have no \textit{other} desire on earth.
\verse My flesh and heart failed, 
\textit{but} God \textit{is} the \textit{strength} of my heart and my reward forever.
\verse For indeed, \textit{those} distancing themselves from you will be ruined. 
You destroy each who abandons you for harlotry.

I have set the Lord Adonai \textit{as} my refuge,

\verseWithHeading{A maskil of Asaph.} Listen, O my people, to my teaching. 
Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
\verse I will offer a parable \textit{with} my mouth. 
I will pour out riddles from long ago,
\verse that we have heard and known, 
and our ancestors have told us.
\verse We will not hide \textit{them} from their children, 
telling the next generation the praises of Adonai, 
and his power and his wonders that he has done.
\verse For he established a testimony in Jacob, 
and appointed a law in Israel, 
which he commanded our ancestors 
to teach to their children,
\verse so that \textit{the} next generation might know— 
children \textit{yet to} be born— 
\textit{that} they might rise up and tell their children,
\verse that they might set their confidence in God, 
and not forget the deeds of God, 
but keep his commandments,
\verse and not be like their ancestors, 
a stubborn and rebellious generation, 
a generation \textit{that} did not make ready its heart, 
whose spirit was not faithful \textit{to} God.
\verse The sons of Ephraim, \textit{armed with archers}, 
turned back on \textit{the} day of battle.
\verse They did not keep the covenant of God 
and refused to go in his law.
\verse They also forgot his deeds, 
and his wonders that he had shown them.
\verse In front of their ancestors he did a wonder, 
in the land of Egypt, \textit{in} the region of Zoan.
\verse He split the sea and caused them to go over, 
and he caused waters to stand like a heap.
\verse And he led them with the cloud by day, 
and all night with a fiery light.
\verse He caused rocks to split in the wilderness 
and provided drink abundantly as \textit{from the} depths.
\verse And he brought streams out of \textit{the} rock 
and caused water to flow down like rivers.
\verse But they sinned still further against him 
by rebelling \textit{against the} Most High in the desert.
\verse And they tested God in their heart 
\textit{by} asking food \textit{for their craving}.
\verse And they spoke against God. 
They said, “Is God able 
to prepare a table in the wilderness?
\verse Yes, he struck \textit{the} rock and water flowed 
and streams gushed out, 
\textit{but} can he also give food 
or provide meat for his people?”
\verse Therefore Adonai heard 
and he was very angry, 
and a fire was kindled against Jacob, 
and \textit{his} anger also rose up against Israel,
\verse because they did not believe God, 
and they did not trust his salvation.
\verse Nevertheless, he commanded \textit{the} skies above 
and opened \textit{the} doors of heaven,
\verse and rained down on them manna to eat 
and gave them the grain of heaven.
\verse Humankind ate \textit{the} bread of \textit{angels}. 
He sent them food \textit{enough} to be satisfied.
\verse He caused \textit{the} east wind to blow in the heavens 
and drove along \textit{the} south wind by his strength.
\verse Then he rained meat on them like dust, 
even winged birds like \textit{the} sand of \textit{the} seas.
\verse He caused \textit{them} to fall in the midst of his camp, 
all around his dwellings.
\verse So they ate and were well filled, 
and he brought about \textit{what} they craved.
\verse They had not yet turned aside from their craving, 
\textit{while} their food \textit{was} still in their mouth,
\verse the anger of God rose against them, 
and he killed some of the stoutest of them, 
even the young men of Israel he caused to bow down \textit{in death}.
\verse In spite of all this they sinned further 
and did not believe his wonders.
\verse And he consumed their days with futility  
their years with terror.
\verse When he killed \textit{some of} them, then they sought him, 
and repented and earnestly sought God.
\verse And they remembered that God \textit{was} their rock, 
and God Most High their redeemer.
\verse But they enticed him with their mouth 
and lied to him with their tongue.
\verse For their heart was not steadfast with him, 
nor were they faithful to his covenant.
\verse But he \textit{was} compassionate; he pardoned \textit{their} guilt 
and did not destroy \textit{them}. 
And many \textit{times} he turned back his anger 
and did not stir up all his wrath,
\verse for he remembered that they \textit{were} flesh, 
a passing wind that does not return.
\verse How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness 
and vexed him in \textit{the} wasteland!
\verse So they again tested God 
and distressed the Holy One of Israel.
\verse And they did not remember his \textit{power} 
\textit{when} he redeemed them from the enemy,
\verse how he performed his signs in Egypt 
and his wonders in the region of Zoan,
\verse when he turned their rivers to blood 
so they could not drink \textit{from} their streams.
\verse He sent among them flies that devoured them 
and frogs that destroyed them.
\verse And he gave their crop to the locusts 
and their labor to the locust.
\verse He destroyed their vines with hail 
and their sycamore trees with sleet.
\verse He also handed their cattle over to the hail 
and their livestock to the lightning bolts.
\verse He sent against them his fierce anger, 
rage and indignation and trouble, 
a band of \textit{destroying} angels.
\verse He cleared a path for his anger. 
He did not spare them from death 
but handed their life over to the plague.
\verse And he struck down all \textit{the} firstborn in Egypt, 
\textit{the} first of \textit{their} virility in the tents of Ham.
\verse Then he led out his people like sheep 
and guided them like a herd in the wilderness.
\verse And he led them safely and they were not afraid, 
but the sea covered their enemies.
\verse So he brought them to his holy territory, 
this mountain his right hand acquired.
\verse And he drove out nations before them 
and allocated them for an inheritance by \textit{boundary} line, 
and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
\verse But they tested and rebelled against God Most High 
and did not keep his statutes.
\verse And they turned and were treacherous like their ancestors. 
They twisted like a crooked bow.
\verse For they provoked him to anger with their high places, 
and made him jealous with their images.
\verse God heard and he was very angry 
and rejected Israel utterly.
\verse So he abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh, 
\textit{the} tent he had placed among humankind.
\verse And he gave his strength into captivity 
and his splendor into \textit{the} hand of \textit{the} enemy.
\verse He also handed his people over to the sword, 
and he was very angry with his inheritance.
\verse Fire devoured his young men, 
and his young women were not praised.
\verse His priests fell by the sword, 
and his widows did not weep.
\verse Then the Lord awoke like \textit{one who had been} asleep, 
\textit{awoke} like a warrior who had been drunk with wine.
\verse And he beat back his enemies; 
he gave them over to perpetual scorn.
\verse And he rejected the tent of Joseph, 
and did not chose the tribe of Ephraim,
\verse but chose the tribe of Judah, 
\textit{Mount Zion} that he loved.
\verse And he built his sanctuary like \textit{the} heights, 
like \textit{the} earth that he established forever.
\verse And he chose David his servant 
and took him from \textit{the} sheepfolds.
\verse He brought him from following nursing ewes 
to shepherd Jacob, his people, 
and Israel, his inheritance.
\verse And he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, 
and led them by the skillfulness of his hands.

tell of all his wonderful works.
\verse Boast about his holy name. 
Let the heart of those who seek Adonai rejoice.
\verse Make supplication to Adonai and his might; 
seek his face continually.
\verse Remember his wonders that he has done, 
his signs and the judgments of his mouth,
\verse O offspring of Abraham his servant, 
\textit{you} descendants of Jacob, his chosen ones.
\verse He \textit{is} Adonai our God; 
his judgments \textit{are} in all the earth.
\verse He remembers his covenant forever, 
\textit{the} word \textit{that} he commanded 
for a thousand generations,
\verse that he made with Abraham, 
and by his oath \textit{swore} to Isaac.
\verse He then confirmed it to Jacob as a statute, 
to Israel \textit{as} an everlasting covenant,
\verse saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan 
\textit{as} the allotment \textit{that is} your inheritance.”
\verse When they were \textit{few in number}— 
a trifle—and \textit{were} sojourners in it,
\verse and they wandered about \textit{among the nations}, 
from \textit{one} kingdom to another people,
\verse he allowed no one to oppress them, 
and he rebuked kings on account of them,
\verse “Do not touch my anointed ones, 
nor harm my prophets.”
\verse Then he called for a famine upon the land; 
he broke every \textit{supply} of bread.
\verse He sent a man on ahead of them; 
Joseph was sold as a slave.
\verse They clamped his feet in fetters. 
His neck went into irons.
\verse Until \textit{the} time his word came about, 
the word of Adonai tested him.
\verse \textit{The} king sent and he freed him; 
\textit{the} ruler of \textit{the} peoples \textit{sent} and let him loose.
\verse He made him lord of his house 
and ruler of all his possessions,

and teach his elders wisdom.
\verse Then Israel came \textit{to} Egypt, 
and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Ham.
\verse And he made his people very fruitful. 
He also made them stronger than their enemies.
\verse He turned their heart to hate his people, 
to deal deceitfully against his servants.
\verse He sent his servant Moses, 
together with Aaron whom he had chosen.
\verse They set before them the words concerning his signs 
and portents in the land of Ham.
\verse He sent darkness and made \textit{it} dark, 
and they did not rebel against his words.
\verse He turned their waters into blood 
and it killed their fish.
\verse Their land swarmed with frogs, 
\textit{even} in the chambers of their kings.
\verse He spoke, and there came flies 
\textit{and} gnats throughout all their territory.
\verse He gave hail for their rains 
\textit{and the} fire of lightning in their land.
\verse And he struck their vines and fig trees, 
and shattered the trees of their territory.
\verse He spoke and there came locusts 
and young locusts without number.
\verse And they ate up all \textit{the} vegetation in their land, 
and they ate up the fruit of their ground.
\verse And he struck down all \textit{the} firstborn in their land, 
\textit{the} first of all their virility.
\verse Then he brought them out with silver and gold, 
and there was none among his tribes who stumbled.
\verse Egypt was glad when they departed, 
because the fear of them had fallen upon them.
\verse He spread out a cloud for a covering, 
and fire to give light at night.
\verse They asked, and he brought quail, 
and satisfied them with \textit{the} bread of heaven.
\verse He opened \textit{the} rock and waters flowed; 
they coursed through the dry places \textit{like} a river.
\verse For he remembered his holy \textit{promise}; 
\textit{he remembered} Abraham his servant.
\verse And \textit{so} he brought out his people with joy, 
his chosen ones with rejoicing.

\verse Who can utter the mighty deeds of Adonai, 
\textit{or} proclaim all his praise?
\verse Blessed are \textit{those who} observe justice, 
\textit{he who} does righteousness at all times.
\verse Remember me, O Adonai, when \textit{you show} favor to your people. 
Look after me when you deliver,
\verse that \textit{I} may see the good \textit{done} your chosen ones, 
to be glad in the joy of your nation, 
to glory together with your inheritance.
\verse We have sinned \textit{along} with our ancestors. 
We have committed iniquity; we have incurred guilt.
\verse Our ancestors in Egypt did not understand your wonderful works. 
They did not remember your many acts of loyal love, 
and \textit{so} they rebelled by \textit{the} sea at \textit{the Red Sea}.
\verse Yet he saved them for the sake of his name, 
to make known his might.
\verse So he rebuked \textit{the Red Sea}, and it dried up, 
and he led them through the deep as \textit{through} a desert.
\verse Thus he saved them from \textit{the} hand of \textit{the} hater 
and redeemed them from \textit{the} hand of \textit{the} enemy.
\verse But waters covered their adversaries; 
not one of them survived.
\verse Then they believed his words; 
they sang his praise.
\verse They quickly forgot his works; 
they did not wait for his counsel.
\verse And they \textit{craved intensely} in the wilderness, 
and tested God in \textit{the} desert.
\verse So he gave to them their request, 
but he sent leanness into their souls.
\verse And they were jealous of Moses in the camp, 
\textit{and} of Aaron, the holy one of Adonai.
\verse \textit{The} earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, 
and it covered over the gang of Abiram.
\verse Also fire burned in their assembly; 
\textit{the} flame devoured \textit{the} wicked.
\verse They made a calf at Horeb 
and bowed down to a cast image.
\verse And \textit{so} they exchanged their glory 
for an image of an ox that eats grass.
\verse They forgot God their Savior, 
who had done great things in Egypt,
\verse wonders in the land of Ham, 
awesome deeds by \textit{the Red Sea}.
\verse So he said he would exterminate them, 
had not Moses, his chosen one, 
stood in the breach before him, 
to reverse his wrath from destroying \textit{them}.
\verse Then they refused the desirable land; 
they did not believe his word,
\verse but grumbled in their tents. 
They did not obey the voice of Adonai.
\verse So \textit{he made an oath} against them, 
to make them drop in the wilderness,
\verse and to disperse their \textit{descendants} among the nations 
and to scatter them among the lands.
\verse They also attached themselves to Baal of Peor, 
and they ate sacrifices offered to \textit{the} dead.
\verse Thus they provoked to anger by their deeds, 
and a plague broke out among them.
\verse Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, 
and \textit{so} the plague was stopped,
\verse and it was reckoned to him as righteousness 
\textit{throughout all generations}.
\verse They also angered \textit{God} at the waters of Meribah, 
and it went badly for Moses on account of them,
\verse because they rebelled against his Spirit, 
and he spoke thoughtlessly with his lips.
\verse They did not exterminate the peoples, 
as Adonai had commanded them, 
\verse but they mingled with the nations 
and learned their works,
\verse and served their idols, 
which became a snare to them.
\verse They even sacrificed their sons and daughters 
to the demons,
\verse and they poured out innocent blood, 
the blood of their sons and daughters, 
whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, 
and \textit{so} the land was defiled with the blood.
\verse And they became unclean by their works, 
and were unfaithful in their deeds.
\verse So Adonai’s anger burned against his people, 
and he abhorred his inheritance.
\verse Then he gave them into \textit{the} hand of \textit{the} nations, 
and those who hated them ruled over them.
\verse And their enemies oppressed them, 
and they were subdued under their hand.
\verse Many times he delivered them, 
but they rebelled in their counsel, 
and were brought low by their iniquity.
\verse Yet he looked upon their distress 
when he heard their cry.
\verse And he remembered his covenant with them, 
and relented based on the abundance of his loyal love.
\verse And he \textit{let them find compassion} 
before all their captors.
\verse Save us, O Adonai our God, 
and gather us from the nations, 
so that \textit{we may} give thanks to your holy name 
\textit{and} boast in your praise.

\verse They also surround me with words of hate, 
and fight me without cause.
\verse In return for my love they accuse me, 
though I \textit{am in} prayer.
\verse So they inflicted evil against me in return for good 
and hatred in return for my love.
\verse Appoint over him a wicked \textit{man},

\verse When he is judged, let him come out guilty, 
and let his prayer become as sin.

and my heart is wounded within me.
\verse Like a lengthening shadow I am passing away; 
I am shaken off like a locust.
\verse My knees \textit{buckle} from fasting, 
and my body grows lean without fat.

save me according to your loyal love,
