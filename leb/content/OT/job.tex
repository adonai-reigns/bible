\begin{biblechapter} % Job 1
\verseWithHeading{Job’s Character and Greatness} \textit{There} was a man in the land of Uz whose name \textit{was} Job. That man was blameless and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil.
\verse And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.
\verse Then his livestock came to be seven thousand sheep and goats and three thousand camels and five hundred pairs of oxen and five hundred female donkeys, and he had very many slaves, and that man was greater than all the people of the east.
\verse And his sons used to go and hold a feast \textit{at each other’s house} on his day, and they would send, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
\verse \textit{Then when} the days of the feast had run their course, \textit{Job would send}, and he would sanctify them. Thus he would arise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings \textit{according to} the number of all of them, because Job thought, “Perhaps my children have sinned and \textit{cursed} God in their heart.” This is what Job used to do \textit{all the time}.
\verse And it happened \textit{one day} \textit{that} the sons of God came to present themselves before Adonai, and Satan also came into their midst.
\verse So Adonai said to Satan, “From where have you come?” Then Satan answered Adonai and said, “From roaming on the earth and from walking about in it.”
\verse So Adonai said to Satan, “Have you \textit{considered} my servant Job? Indeed, there is no one like him on the earth—a blameless man and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil.”
\verse Then Satan answered Adonai and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?
\verse Have you not put a fence around him and his household and around \textit{all that belongs to him} \textit{on every side}? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock has increased in the land.
\verse But, on the other hand, stretch out your hand and touch \textit{all that belongs to him} \textit{and see} \textit{whether} he will \textit{curse} you to your face.”
\verse So Adonai said to Satan, “Look, \textit{all that belongs to him} is in your \textit{power}. Only do not stretch out your hand \textit{against} him.” So Satan went out from Adonai’s \textit{presence}.
\verseWithHeading{The Adversary’s Attack on Job’s Possessions} And then \textit{there} was one day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother’s house.
\verse And a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the female donkeys were feeding \textit{beside them}.
\verse Then the Sabeans \textit{attacked}, and they took them, and they slew the servants \textit{by the edge of the sword}. But I escaped, \textit{even} I alone, to tell you.”
\verse While this one was still speaking, \textit{another} came and said, “The fire of God fell from the heavens, and it blazed up against the sheep and goats and against the servants, and it consumed them. But I escaped, \textit{even} I alone, to tell you.”
\verse While this one was still speaking, \textit{another} came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three divisions, and they made a raid on the camels, and they carried them away, and they struck your servants \textit{by the edge of the sword}, but I escaped, \textit{even} I alone, to tell you.”
\verse At the time this one was speaking, \textit{another} came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother’s house.
\verse And behold, a great wind came from across the desert, and it struck the four corners of the house \textit{so that} it fell upon the young people, and they died. But I escaped, \textit{even} I alone, to tell you.”
\verse Then Job arose and tore his outer garment and shaved his head; \textit{then} he fell upon the ground and he worshiped.
\verse Then he said, “Naked I came out from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return there. Adonai gives, and Adonai takes. Let Adonai’s name be blessed.”
\verse In all this, Job did not sin and did not \textit{charge God with wrongdoing}.

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 2
\verseWithHeading{The Adversary’s Attack on Job’s Person} \textit{And then} one day the sons of God came to present themselves before Adonai, and Satan also came into their midst to present himself before Adonai.
\verse So Adonai \textit{asked} Satan, “From where have you come?” And Satan answered Adonai and said, “From roaming on the earth and from walking about in it.”
\verse So Adonai \textit{asked} Satan, “Have you \textit{considered} my servant Job? Indeed, there is no one like him on the earth—a blameless man and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil. And still he persists in his blamelessness \textit{even though} you incited me against him to destroy him for nothing.”
\verse Then Satan answered him and said, “Skin for skin! All that \textit{that} man has he will give for his life.
\verse But stretch out your hand and touch his bones and his flesh, \textit{and see} \textit{whether} he will \textit{curse} you to your face.”
\verse So Adonai said to Satan, “\textit{All right}, he \textit{is} in your \textit{power}. Only spare his life.”
\verseWithHeading{Job’s Blameless Behavior} So Satan went out from \textit{Adonai’s presence}, and he inflicted Job with loathsome skin sores from the sole of his foot up to the crown of his head.
\verse \textit{So} he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and he sat in the midst of the ashes.
\verse Then his wife said to him, “Are you still persisting in your blamelessness? \textit{Curse} God and die.”
\verse So he said to her, “You speak like one of the foolish women speaks. Indeed, should we receive the good from God, but not receive the evil?” In all this, Job did not sin with his lips.
\verse Thus Job’s three friends heard of this calamity that had come upon him. So each set out from his \textit{own} place: Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite. And they met together to come to console him and to comfort him.
\verse Thus they lifted up their eyes from afar, but they did not recognize him, so they raised their voice, and they wept, and each man tore his outer garment and threw dust on their heads \textit{toward the sky}.
\verse Then they sat with him on the ground \textit{for} seven days and seven nights, but no one spoke a word to him because they saw that \textit{his} suffering was very great.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 3
\verseWithHeading{Job Regrets His Birth} \textit{Afterward} Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.
\verse Thus Job \textit{spoke up} and said,
\verse “Let \textit{the} day perish on which I was born, 
and the night that said, ‘A man-child is conceived.’
\verse Let that day become darkness; 
may God not seek it from above, 
nor may daylight shine on it.
\verse Let darkness and deep shadow claim it; 
let clouds settle on it; 
let them terrify it \textit{with the} blackness of day.
\verse Let darkness seize that night; 
let it not rejoice among \textit{the} days of \textit{the} year; 
let it not enter among \textit{the} number of \textit{the} months.
\verse Look, let that night become barren; 
let a joyful song not enter it.
\verse Let those who curse the day curse it, 
those who are skilled at rousing Leviathan.
\verse Let the stars of its dawn be dark; 
let it hope for light but there be none, 
and let it not see \textit{the} eyelids of dawn
\verse because it did not shut the doors of my \textit{mother’s} womb, 
nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.
\verseWithHeading{Job Wishes He Had Died} “Why did I not die at birth? 
\textit{Why} did I \textit{not} come forth from \textit{the} womb and expire?
\verse Why did \textit{the} knees receive me 
and the breasts, that I could suck?
\verse For now I would lie down, and I would be at peace; 
I would be asleep; then \textit{I would be at rest}
\verse with kings and counselors of \textit{the} earth, 
who \textit{rebuild}  ruins for themselves,
\verse or with high officials \textit{who have gold}, 
who fill up their houses \textit{with} silver.
\verse Or \textit{why} was I not hidden like a miscarriage, 
like infants \textit{who} did not see \textit{the} light?
\verse There \textit{the} wicked cease from troubling, 
and there \textit{the} \textit{weary} are at rest;
\verse \textit{the} prisoners are at ease together; 
they do not hear \textit{the} oppressor’s voice.
\verse \textit{The} small and \textit{the} great \textit{are} there, 
and \textit{the} slave \textit{is} free from his masters.
\verseWithHeading{Job Wishes He Might Die} “Why does he give light to one in misery 
and life to \textit{those} bitter of soul,
\verse who wait for death, but \textit{it does not come}, 
and search \textit{for} it more than \textit{for} treasures,
\verse who rejoice \textit{exceedingly}, 
\textit{and} they are glad when they find \textit{the} grave?
\verse \textit{Why does he give light} to a man whose way is hidden, 
and God has fenced him in \textit{all} around?
\verse For my sighing comes \textit{before} my bread, 
and my groanings gush forth like water
\verse because the dread that I \textit{feel} has come upon me, 
and what I feared befalls me.
\verse I am not at ease, and I am not at peace, 
and I do not have rest, thus turmoil has come.”
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 4
\verseWithHeading{Eliphaz’s First Response to Job} Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
\verse “\textit{If} someone would test a word with you, would you be offended? 
But who can refrain from speaking?
\verse Look, you have instructed many, 
and you have strengthened weak hands.
\verse Your words have raised up \textit{the one who} stumbles, 
and you have strengthened knees giving way.
\verse But now it has come to you, and you are worn out; 
it touches you, and you are horrified.
\verse \textit{Is} not your fear \textit{in God} your confidence? 
\textit{Is not} your hope even the integrity of your ways?
\verse “\textit{Think} now, who has perished \textit{who is} innocent? 
Or where \textit{are} the upright destroyed?
\verse \textit{Just} as I have seen, plowers of mischief 
and sowers of trouble will reap it.
\verse By the breath of God they perish, 
and by the blast of his anger they come to an end.
\verse \textit{The} roar of \textit{the} lion and \textit{the} voice of a lion in its prime, 
and \textit{the} teeth of \textit{the} young lions are broken.
\verse \textit{The} lion is perishing without prey, 
and \textit{the} lion’s whelps are scattered.
\verse “And a word came stealing to me, 
and my ear received \textit{the} whisper from it.
\verse Amid troubling thoughts from night visions, 
at \textit{the} falling of deep sleep on men,
\verse dread met me, and trembling, 
and it made many of my bones shake.
\verse And a spirit glided before my face; 
the hair of my flesh bristled.
\verse It stood still, but I could not recognize its appearance; 
a form \textit{was} \textit{before} my eyes; 
\textit{there was} a hush, and I heard a voice:
\verse ‘Can a human being be more righteous than God, 
or can a man be more pure than his Maker?
\verse Look, he does not trust in his servants 
and he charges his angels with error.
\verse How much more dwellers in clay houses, 
whose foundation \textit{is} in the dust? 
They are crushed like a moth.
\verse \textit{Between morning and evening} they are destroyed; 
without \textit{anyone} regarding \textit{it} they perish forever.
\verse \textit{Is} not their tent cord pulled up within them? 
They die, but not in wisdom.’

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 5
\verseWithHeading{Eliphaz’s Response Continues} “Call now, is there \textit{anyone} answering you? 
And to which of \textit{the} holy ones will you turn?
\verse For vexation will slay the fool, 
and jealousy will kill \textit{the} simple.
\verse I have seen a fool taking root, 
but suddenly I cursed his dwelling.
\verse His children are far from deliverance, 
and they are crushed in the gate, 
and there is no deliverer—
\verse whose harvest \textit{the} hungry eats, 
and he takes it \textit{from behind} \textit{the} thorns; 
and \textit{the} thirsty pants after their wealth.
\verse Indeed, mischief does not come from the dust, 
and trouble does not sprout from the earth.
\verse But a human being is born to trouble, 
and \textit{they soar aloft} \textit{like} \textit{sparks}.
\verse “But I myself will seek God, 
and to God I would commit my cause.
\verse \textit{He} is doing great and \textit{unsearchable} things, 
marvelous things \textit{without number}—
\verse the one who is giving rain on \textit{the} \textit{surface of} \textit{the} earth 
and is sending water on \textit{the} \textit{surface of} \textit{the} fields,
\verse to set \textit{the} lowly on high, 
and \textit{those} mourning are lifted to safety.
\verse \textit{He} is frustrating \textit{the} devices of \textit{the} crafty, 
and their hands do not achieve success.
\verse \textit{He} is capturing \textit{the} wise in their craftiness, 
and the schemes of the wily are rushed.
\verse In the daytime they meet \textit{with} darkness, 
and they grope at noon as \textit{in} the night.
\verse And he saves from the sword of their mouth, 
\textit{even} \textit{the} poor from the hand of the strong.
\verse So there is hope for the powerless, 
and wickedness shuts its mouth.
\verse “Look, happy \textit{is the} human being whom God reproves; 
and you must not despise the discipline of Shaddai,
\verse for he himself wounds, but he binds up; 
he strikes, but his hands heal.
\verse \textit{From} six troubles he will deliver you, 
and in seven evil shall not touch you.
\verse In famine he will redeem you from death, 
and in war from \textit{the} \textit{power of} \textit{the} sword.
\verse From \textit{the} scourge of \textit{the} tongue you shall be hidden, 
and you shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes.
\verse At destruction and famine you shall laugh, 
and you shall not fear the wild animals of the earth.
\verse For your covenant \textit{will be} with the stones of the field, 
and the wild animals of the field will be at peace with you.
\verse And you shall know that your tent \textit{is} safe, 
and you will inspect your fold, and you shall not be missing \textit{anything}.
\verse And you shall know that your offspring \textit{are} many, 
and your descendants like the vegetation of the earth.
\verse You shall come in maturity to \textit{the} grave, 
as the raising up of a stack of sheaves in its season.
\verse “Look, we have searched this out—it \textit{is} true; 
hear it and know \textit{it} \textit{yourself}.”

\verseWithHeading{Job’s Second Speech: A Response to Eliphaz}  Then Job answered and said,
\verse “If only my vexation could be well weighed, 
and my calamity could be lifted up together \textit{with it} in \textit{the} balances,
\verse for then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; 
therefore my words have been rash,
\verse for the arrows of Shaddai \textit{are} in me; 
my spirit drinks their poison; 
the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
\verse Does \textit{the} wild ass bray over grass, 
or \textit{the} ox bellow over its fodder?
\verse Can tasteless \textit{food} be eaten without salt, 
or is there taste in the white of a marshmallow plant?
\verse \textit{I refused} to touch \textit{them}; 
they \textit{are} like \textit{food that will make me ill}.
\verse “\textit{O that} my request may come, 
and \textit{that} God may grant my hope,
\verse that God would decide that he would crush me, 
\textit{that} he would let loose his hand and \textit{kill me}.
\verse But it will still be my consolation, 
and I would recoil in \textit{unrelenting} pain, 
for I have not denied \textit{the} words of \textit{the} Holy One.
\verse What \textit{is} my strength, that I should wait? 
And what \textit{is} my end, that \textit{I should hold out}?
\verse Or \textit{is} my strength \textit{like} the strength of stones? 
Or \textit{is} my flesh bronze?
\verse \textit{Indeed}, my help is not in me, 
and \textit{any} success is driven from me.
\verse “Loyal love \textit{should come} for the afflicted \textit{from} his friend, 
even if he forsakes the fear of Shaddai.
\verse My companions are treacherous like a torrent-bed; 
like a streambed of wadis they flow away,
\verse which are growing dark because of ice upon them, 
it will pile up snow.
\verse In time they dry up, they disappear; 
when it \textit{is} hot, they vanish from their place.
\verse The paths of their way wind \textit{around}; 
they go up into the wasteland, and they perish.
\verse The caravans of Tema looked; 
the traveling merchants of Sheba hope for them.
\verse They are disappointed, because they trusted; 
they came \textit{here} and they are confounded.
\verse “For now you have become \textit{such}; 
you see terrors, and you fear.
\verse Is it because I have said, ‘Give to me,’ 
or, ‘Offer a bribe for me from your wealth’?
\verse or, ‘Save me from the foe’s hand,’ 
or, ‘Ransom me from the tyrants’ hand’?
\verse Teach me, and I myself will be silent; 
and make me understand how I have gone astray.
\verse How painful are \textit{upright words}! 
But what does \textit{your reproof} reprove?
\verse Do you intend to reprove \textit{my} words 
and \textit{consider the} words of a desperate \textit{man} as wind?
\verse Even over \textit{the} orphan you would cast the lot, 
and you would bargain over your friend.
\verse “\textit{Therefore} be prepared, turn to me, 
and I surely will not lie to your face.
\verse Please turn, let no injustice happen; 
indeed, turn, \textit{my righteousness is still intact}.
\verse Is there injustice on my tongue? 
Or can my palate not discern calamity?

\verseWithHeading{Job’s Second Speech: A Response to Eliphaz} “Does not \textit{a human being have hard service} on earth? 
And \textit{are not} his days like the days of a laborer?
\verse Like a slave he longs for \textit{the} shadow, 
and like a laborer he waits for his wages.
\verse So \textit{I had to inherit} months of worthlessness, 
and nights of misery are apportioned to me.
\verse When I lie down, I say, ‘When shall I rise?’ 
But \textit{the} night is long, 
and I have my fill of tossing until dawn.
\verse My body is clothed \textit{with} maggots and clods of dust; 
my skin hardens, then it gives way \textit{again}.
\verse “My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, 
and they come to an end \textit{without hope}.
\verse Remember that my life \textit{is} a breath; 
my eye will not return to see good.
\verse The eye of \textit{the one} seeing me will not see me;

\verse A cloud vanishes, and it goes away,

\verse Am I \textit{the} sea, or a sea monster,

\verse When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me, 
and my couch will ease my complaint,’
\verse then you terrify me with dreams, 
and with visions you terrify me.
\verse So my inner self will choose strangling— 
death more than my \textit{existence}.
\verse I loathe \textit{my life}; I would not live forever; 
depart from me, for my days \textit{are} a breath.

\verse \textit{How long} will you not turn away from me? 
\textit{Or} not leave me alone until I swallow my spit?
\verse \textit{If} I have sinned, what have I done to you, watcher of humanity? 
Why have you made me as a target for yourself, 
so that I have become a burden to myself?
\verse And why do you not pardon my transgression

For now I shall lie in the dust, 
and you will seek me, but \textit{I will be no more}.”

But if \textit{it is a matter of} justice, who can summon me?
\verse Even though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me;

and to cause \textit{the ground} to put forth \textit{the} rising of grass?
\verse Is there a father for the rain, 
or who fathered \textit{the} drops of dew?
\verse From whose womb did the ice come forth, 
and who fathered \textit{the} frost of heaven?
\verse Like stone \textit{the} waters become hard, 
and \textit{the} faces of the deep freeze.
\verse “Can you bind \textit{the} chains of \textit{the} Pleiades, 
or can you loosen \textit{the} cords of Orion?
\verse Can you lead forth the southern constellations at their appointed time, 
or can you lead \textit{the} Bear with its children?
\verse Do you know heaven’s statutes, 
or can you establish their rule on the earth?
\verse Can you lift up your voice to the clouds 
so that a flood of water may cover you?
\verse Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go? 
And will they say to you, ‘Here we are’?
\verse Who has put wisdom in the ibis, 
or who has given understanding to the rooster?
\verse Who can number \textit{the} clouds with wisdom? 
Or who can tilt heaven’s jars,
\verse at \textit{the} flowing of \textit{the} dust into a cast 
and \textit{the} clods cling together?
\verse “Can you hunt prey for \textit{the} lion? 
And can you satisfy \textit{the} hunger of strong lions
\verse when they are crouched in the dens, 
\textit{when} they lie in the thicket in an ambush?
\verse Who prepares for the crow its prey, 
when its young ones cry to God for help, 
\textit{and} they wander around \textit{for lack of food}?

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 39
\verse “Do you know \textit{the} time when \textit{the} goats of \textit{the} rocks give birth? 
Do you observe \textit{the} doe deer’s giving birth?
\verse Can you number \textit{the} months they fulfill, 
and do you know \textit{the} time of its giving birth?
\verse When they crouch, they bring forth their young ones; 
they get rid of their labor pains.
\verse Their young ones grow strong; they grow up in the open; 
they go forth and do not return to them.
\verse “Who has sent forth \textit{the} wild ass free? 
And who has released \textit{the} wild donkey’s bonds,
\verse \textit{to} which I have given \textit{the} wilderness \textit{as} its house 
and \textit{the} salt flat \textit{as} its dwelling place?
\verse It scorns \textit{the} city’s turmoil; 
it does not hear \textit{the} driver’s shouts.
\verse It explores \textit{the} mountains \textit{as} its pasture 
and searches after every kind of green plant.
\verse “Is \textit{the} wild ox willing to serve you, 
or will he spend the night at your feeding trough?
\verse Can you tie \textit{the} wild ox \textit{with} its rope to a furrow, 
or will it harrow \textit{the} valleys after you?
\verse Can you trust it because its strength \textit{is} great, 
or will you hand your labor over to it?
\verse Can you rely on it that it will return your grain 
and \textit{that} it will gather \textit{it} to your threshing floor?
\verse “\textit{The} wings of \textit{the} female ostrich flap— 
\textit{are they} \textit{the} pinions of \textit{the} stork or \textit{the} falcon?
\verse Indeed, it leaves its eggs to the earth, 
and it lets \textit{them} be warmed on \textit{the} ground,
\verse and it forgets that a foot might crush an egg, 
and \textit{a wild animal} might trample it.
\verse It deals cruelly with its young ones, as \textit{if} \textit{they were} not its \textit{own}, 
as \textit{if} without fear \textit{that} its labor \textit{were} in vain,
\verse because God made it forget wisdom, 
and he did not give it a share in understanding.
\verse When it spreads its wings \textit{aloft}, 
it laughs at the horse and its rider.
\verse “Do you give power to the horse? 
Do you clothe its neck \textit{with} a mane?
\verse Do you make it leap like the locust? 
\textit{The} majesty of its snorting \textit{is} terrifying.
\verse They paw in the valley, and it exults with strength; 
it goes out to meet \textit{the} battle.
\verse It laughs at danger and is not dismayed, 
and it does not turn back from \textit{before} \textit{the} sword.
\verse Upon it \textit{the} quiver rattles 
\textit{along with} \textit{the} flash of \textit{the} spear and \textit{the} short sword.
\verse With roar and rage \textit{it races over the ground}, 
and it cannot stand still at \textit{the} sound of \textit{the} horn.
\verse \textit{Whenever} a horn \textit{sounds}, it says, ‘Aha!’ 
And it smells \textit{the} battle from a distance— 
\textit{the} thunder of \textit{the} commanders and \textit{the} war cry.
\verse “Does \textit{the} hawk soar by your wisdom? 
Does it spread its wings to \textit{the} south?
\verse Or does \textit{the} eagle fly high at your command 
and construct its nest high?
\verse It lives \textit{on the} rock and spends the night 
\textit{on the rock point and the mountain stronghold}.
\verse From there it spies out \textit{the} prey; 
its eyes look from far away.
\verse And its young ones lick blood greedily, 
and where \textit{the} dead carcasses \textit{are}, there they \textit{are}.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 40
\verse Then Adonai answered Job and said,
\verse “Shall a faultfinder contend with Shaddai? 
Anyone who argues with God must answer it.”
\verseWithHeading{Job Responds to Adonai} So Job answered Adonai and said,
\verse “Look, I am insignificant. 
What shall I answer you? 
I lay my hand on my mouth.
\verse Once I have spoken, and I will not answer; 
even twice, but I will not proceed.”
\verseWithHeading{Adonai Challenges Job Again} Then Adonai answered Job from the storm, and he said,
\verse “\textit{Prepare yourself for a difficult task like a man}, 
and I will question you, and you shall declare to me.
\verseWithHeading{Adonai Interrogates Job Again} “Indeed, would you annul my justice? 
Would you condemn me, so that you might be righteous?
\verse Or do you have an arm like God, 
and can you thunder with a voice like his?
\verse Adorn yourself \textit{with} pride and dignity, 
and clothe yourself \textit{with} splendor.
\verse Pour out the overflowing of your anger, 
and look at all \textit{the} proud, and humble them.
\verse Look at all \textit{the} proud, humble them, 
and tread down \textit{the} wicked \textit{where they stand}.
\verse Hide them in the dust together; 
bind their faces in the grave.
\verse And I will also praise you, 
that your \textit{own} right hand can save you.
\verse “Look, Behemoth, which I have made just as \textit{I made} you; 
it eats grass like the ox.
\verse Look, its strength \textit{is} in its loins 
and its power in the muscles of its stomach.
\verse It keeps its tail straight like a cedar; 
\textit{the} sinews of its thighs are tightly wound.
\verse Its bones \textit{are} tubes of copper, 
its limbs like rods of iron.
\verse “It \textit{is} the first of God’s actions; 
the \textit{one who} made him furnishes \textit{it with} his sword.
\verse Yes, \textit{the} mountains yield produce for it, 
and all \textit{wild animals} play there.
\verse Under \textit{the} lotus tree it lies, 
in \textit{the} hiding place of \textit{the} reeds and \textit{in the} marsh.
\verse \textit{The} lotus trees cover it \textit{with} their shade; 
\textit{the} wadi’s poplar trees surround it.
\verse Look, \textit{if the} river is turbulent, it is not frightened; 
it is confident even though \textit{the} Jordan rushes against its mouth.
\verse Can anyone take it by its eyes? 
Can he pierce \textit{its} nose with a snare?

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 41
\verse  “Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook? 
Or \textit{can you tie down its mouth with a cord}?
\verse Can you put a rope in its nose? 
Or can you pierce its jawbone with a hook?
\verse Will it make numerous pleas for mercy to you? 
Or will it speak gentle words to you?
\verse Will it make a covenant with you? 
Will you take it as a slave forever?
\verse Will you play with it as \textit{with} birds 
and put it on a leash for your girls?
\verse Will guildsmen bargain over it? 
Will they divide it between tradesmen?
\verse Can you fill its kin with harpoons 
or its head with fish spears?
\verse Lay your hands on it; 
think about \textit{the} battle—you will not do \textit{it} again!
\verse “Look, \textit{the hope of capturing it} is false. 
Will one be hurled down even at its sight?
\verse \textit{Is} it not fierce when somebody stirs it? 
Who \textit{then} \textit{is} he \textit{who} would stand \textit{before it}?
\verse Who has come to confront me, that I should repay \textit{him}? 
Under all the heavens, \textit{it belongs to me}.
\verse “I will not keep quiet \textit{concerning} its limbs 
or concerning \textit{the} extent of its might and \textit{the} gracefulness of its frame.
\verse Who can strip off \textit{its outer covering}? 
Who can penetrate its double harness?
\verse Who can open \textit{the} doors of its face? 
Its teeth all around \textit{are} fearsome.
\verse Its back \textit{has} scales of shields; 
it is shut up closely \textit{as with} a seal.
\verse They are close \textit{to one another}— 
even \textit{the} air cannot come between them.
\verse They are joined \textit{one to another}; 
they cling together and cannot be separated.
\verse “Its snorting flashes forth light, 
and its eyes \textit{are} \textit{red like dawn}.
\verse Torches go from its mouth; 
sparks of fire shoot out.
\verse Smoke comes from its nostrils 
as \textit{from} a kettle boiling and \textit{burning} bulrushes.
\verse Its breath kindles charcoal, 
and a flame comes from its mouth.
\verse “Strength abides in its neck, 
and dismay dances \textit{before it}.
\verse Its flesh’s folds of skin cling together; 
it is cast on it—it will not be moved.
\verse Its heart is cast as stone; 
yes, it is cast as \textit{the} lower millstone.
\verse \textit{When it raises itself}, \textit{the} mighty ones are terrified; 
they retreat because of its thrashing.
\verse Reaching it \textit{with the} sword does not avail, 
\textit{nor} \textit{with the} spear, \textit{the} dart, or \textit{the} javelin.
\verse It regards iron as straw, 
bronze as rotten wood.
\verse \textit{An arrow} will not make it flee; 
sling stones are turned to stubble for it.
\verse Clubs are regarded as stubble, 
and it laughs at \textit{the} short sword’s rattle.
\verse “Its underparts \textit{are} shards of a potsherd; 
it moves over mud \textit{like} a threshing sledge.
\verse It makes \textit{the} deep boil like a cooking pot; 
it makes \textit{the} sea like a pot of ointment.
\verse Behind it, \textit{it leaves a glistening wake}; 
one would think \textit{that} the deep \textit{has} gray hair.
\verse “\textit{On the ground it has no equal}— 
a creature without fear.
\verse It observes all \textit{the} lofty; 
it \textit{is} king \textit{over all that are proud}.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 42
\verseWithHeading{Job’s Repentance and Restoration} Then Job answered Adonai and said,
\verse “I know that you can do all \textit{things}, 
and \textit{any} scheme from you will not be thwarted.
\verse ‘Who \textit{is} this darkening counsel without knowledge?’ 
Therefore I uttered, but I did not understand; 
\textit{things too wonderful for me}, but I did not know.
\verse ‘Hear and I will speak; 
I will question you, then inform me.’
\verse By the ear’s hearing I heard \textit{of} you, 
but now my eye has seen you.
\verse Therefore I despise \textit{myself} 
and repent in dust and ashes.”
\verse \textit{And then} after Adonai spoke these words to Job, Adonai said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “\textit{My wrath has been kindled} against you and against \textit{the} two of your friends, for you have not spoken to me what is right as my servant Job \textit{has}.
\verse \textit{So then}, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job will pray for you, for \textit{I will certainly accept his prayer}, so that it will not be done with you \textit{according to your} folly, for you have not spoken to me what is right as my servant Job \textit{has}.”
\verse So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite \textit{and} Zophar the Naamathite went and did just as Adonai had told them, and \textit{Adonai accepted Job’s prayer}.
\verse Then Adonai returned Job’s fortune when he prayed to him on behalf of his friends. Thus Adonai increased \textit{all that Job had twice as much as before}.
\verse So all his brothers and all his sisters and all \textit{those who} had known him \textit{before} came to him, and they ate bread with him in his house and showed sympathy to him and comforted him for all the disaster that Adonai had brought upon him. Then each one gave to him one piece of money, and each one \textit{gave to him} one ornamental ring of gold.
\verse So Adonai blessed Job’s latter days more than his beginning. \textit{Thus he had} fourteen thousand sheep and goats and six thousand camels and a thousand pair of oxen and a thousand female donkeys.
\verse \textit{And he had} seven sons and three daughters.
\verse And he called the name of the first Jemimah and the name of the second Keziah and the name of the third Qeren-Happuk.
\verse And beautiful women were not found in all the land like Job’s daughters, and their father gave to them an inheritance in the midst of their brothers.
\verse And Job lived after this one hundred and forty years, and he saw his sons and his \textit{grandsons} \textit{for} four generations.
\verse Then Job died old and full of days.
