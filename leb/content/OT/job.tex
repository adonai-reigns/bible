\begin{biblechapter} % Job 1
\verseWithHeading{Job’s Character and Greatness} There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil.
\verse And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.
\verse Then his livestock came to be seven thousand sheep and goats and three thousand camels and five hundred pairs of oxen and five hundred female donkeys, and he had very many slaves, and that man was greater than all the people of the east.
\verse And his sons used to go and hold a feast \textit{at each other’s house} on his day, and they would send, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
\verse \textit{Then when} the days of the feast had run their course, \textit{Job would send}, and he would sanctify them. Thus he would arise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of all of them, because Job thought, “Perhaps my children have sinned and \textit{cursed} God in their heart.” This is what Job used to do \textit{all the time}.
\verse And it happened \textit{one day} \textit{that} the sons of God came to present themselves before Adonai, and Satan also came into their midst.
\verse So Adonai said to Satan, “From where have you come?” Then Satan answered Adonai and said, “From roaming on the earth and from walking about in it.”
\verse So Adonai said to Satan, “Have you \textit{considered} my servant Job? Indeed, there is no one like him on the earth—a blameless man and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil.”
\verse Then Satan answered Adonai and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?
\verse Have you not put a fence around him and his household and around \textit{all that belongs to him} \textit{on every side}? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock has increased in the land.
\verse But, on the other hand, stretch out your hand and touch \textit{all that belongs to him} and see \textit{whether} he will \textit{curse} you to your face.”
\verse So Adonai said to Satan, “Look, \textit{all that belongs to him} is in your \textit{power}. Only do not stretch out your hand \textit{against} him.” So Satan went out from Adonai’s \textit{presence}.
\verseWithHeading{The Adversary’s Attack on Job’s Possessions} And then there was one day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother’s house.
\verse And a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the female donkeys were feeding \textit{beside them}.
\verse Then the Sabeans \textit{attacked}, and they took them, and they slew the servants \textit{by the edge of the sword}. But I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.”
\verse While this one was still speaking, \textit{another} came and said, “The fire of God fell from the heavens, and it blazed up against the sheep and goats and against the servants, and it consumed them. But I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.”
\verse While this one was still speaking, \textit{another} came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three divisions, and they made a raid on the camels, and they carried them away, and they struck your servants \textit{by the edge of the sword}, but I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.”
\verse At the time this one was speaking, \textit{another} came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother’s house.
\verse And behold, a great wind came from across the desert, and it struck the four corners of the house \textit{so that} it fell upon the young people, and they died. But I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.”
\verse Then Job arose and tore his outer garment and shaved his head; \textit{then} he fell upon the ground and he worshiped.
\verse Then he said, “Naked I came out from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return there. Adonai gives, and Adonai takes. Let Adonai’s name be blessed.”
\verse In all this, Job did not sin and did not \textit{charge God with wrongdoing}.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 2
\verseWithHeading{The Adversary’s Attack on Job’s Person} \textit{And then} one day the sons of God came to present themselves before Adonai, and Satan also came into their midst to present himself before Adonai.
\verse So Adonai \textit{asked} Satan, “From where have you come?” And Satan answered Adonai and said, “From roaming on the earth and from walking about in it.”
\verse So Adonai \textit{asked} Satan, “Have you \textit{considered} my servant Job? Indeed, there is no one like him on the earth—a blameless man and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil. And still he persists in his blamelessness \textit{even though} you incited me against him to destroy him for nothing.”
\verse Then Satan answered him and said, “Skin for skin! All that \textit{that} man has he will give for his life.
\verse But stretch out your hand and touch his bones and his flesh, and see \textit{whether} he will \textit{curse} you to your face.”
\verse So Adonai said to Satan, “\textit{All right}, he is in your \textit{power}. Only spare his life.”
\verseWithHeading{Job’s Blameless Behavior} So Satan went out from \textit{Adonai’s presence}, and he inflicted Job with loathsome skin sores from the sole of his foot up to the crown of his head.
\verse \textit{So} he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and he sat in the midst of the ashes.
\verse Then his wife said to him, “Are you still persisting in your blamelessness? \textit{Curse} God and die.”
\verse So he said to her, “You speak like one of the foolish women speaks. Indeed, should we receive the good from God, but not receive the evil?” In all this, Job did not sin with his lips.
\verse Thus Job’s three friends heard of this calamity that had come upon him. So each set out from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite. And they met together to come to console him and to comfort him.
\verse Thus they lifted up their eyes from afar, but they did not recognize him, so they raised their voice, and they wept, and each man tore his outer garment and threw dust on their heads \textit{toward the sky}.
\verse Then they sat with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, but no one spoke a word to him because they saw that \textit{his} suffering was very great.

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 3
\verseWithHeading{Job Regrets His Birth} \textit{Afterward} Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.
\verse Thus Job \textit{spoke up} and said,
\verse “Let the day perish on which I was born, 
and the night that said, ‘A man-child is conceived.’
\verse Let that day become darkness; 
may God not seek it from above, 
nor may daylight shine on it.
\verse Let darkness and deep shadow claim it; 
let clouds settle on it; 
let them terrify it with the blackness of day.
\verse Let darkness seize that night; 
let it not rejoice among the days of the year; 
let it not enter among the number of the months.
\verse Look, let that night become barren; 
let a joyful song not enter it.
\verse Let those who curse the day curse it, 
those who are skilled at rousing Leviathan.
\verse Let the stars of its dawn be dark; 
let it hope for light but there be none, 
and let it not see the eyelids of dawn
\verse because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb, 
nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.
\verseWithHeading{Job Wishes He Had Died} “Why did I not die at birth? 
Why did I not come forth from the womb and expire?
\verse Why did the knees receive me 
and the breasts, that I could suck?
\verse For now I would lie down, and I would be at peace; 
I would be asleep; then \textit{I would be at rest}
\verse with kings and counselors of the earth, 
who \textit{rebuild}  ruins for themselves,
\verse or with high officials \textit{who have gold}, 
who fill up their houses with silver.
\verse Or why was I not hidden like a miscarriage, 
like infants who did not see the light?
\verse There the wicked cease from troubling, 
and there the \textit{weary} are at rest;
\verse the prisoners are at ease together; 
they do not hear the oppressor’s voice.
\verse The small and the great are there, 
and the slave is free from his masters.
\verseWithHeading{Job Wishes He Might Die} “Why does he give light to one in misery 
and life to those bitter of soul,
\verse who wait for death, but \textit{it does not come}, 
and search for it more than for treasures,
\verse who rejoice \textit{exceedingly}, 
and they are glad when they find the grave?
\verse Why does he give light to a man whose way is hidden, 
and God has fenced him in all around?
\verse For my sighing comes \textit{before} my bread, 
and my groanings gush forth like water
\verse because the dread that I \textit{feel} has come upon me, 
and what I feared befalls me.
\verse I am not at ease, and I am not at peace, 
and I do not have rest, thus turmoil has come.”
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 4
\verseWithHeading{Eliphaz’s First Response to Job} Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
\verse “If someone would test a word with you, would you be offended? 
But who can refrain from speaking?
\verse Look, you have instructed many, 
and you have strengthened weak hands.
\verse Your words have raised up the one who stumbles, 
and you have strengthened knees giving way.
\verse But now it has come to you, and you are worn out; 
it touches you, and you are horrified.
\verse Is not your fear in God your confidence? 
Is not your hope even the integrity of your ways?
\verse “\textit{Think} now, who has perished who is innocent? 
Or where are the upright destroyed?
\verse Just as I have seen, plowers of mischief 
and sowers of trouble will reap it.
\verse By the breath of God they perish, 
and by the blast of his anger they come to an end.
\verse The roar of the lion and the voice of a lion in its prime, 
and the teeth of the young lions are broken.
\verse The lion is perishing without prey, 
and the lion’s whelps are scattered.
\verse “And a word came stealing to me, 
and my ear received the whisper from it.
\verse Amid troubling thoughts from night visions, 
at the falling of deep sleep on men,
\verse dread met me, and trembling, 
and it made many of my bones shake.
\verse And a spirit glided before my face; 
the hair of my flesh bristled.
\verse It stood still, but I could not recognize its appearance; 
a form was \textit{before} my eyes; 
there was a hush, and I heard a voice:
\verse ‘Can a human being be more righteous than God, 
or can a man be more pure than his Maker?
\verse Look, he does not trust in his servants 
and he charges his angels with error.
\verse How much more dwellers in clay houses, 
whose foundation is in the dust? 
They are crushed like a moth.
\verse \textit{Between morning and evening} they are destroyed; 
without anyone regarding it they perish forever.
\verse Is not their tent cord pulled up within them? 
They die, but not in wisdom.’

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 5
\verseWithHeading{Eliphaz’s Response Continues} “Call now, is there anyone answering you? 
And to which of the holy ones will you turn?
\verse For vexation will slay the fool, 
and jealousy will kill the simple.
\verse I have seen a fool taking root, 
but suddenly I cursed his dwelling.
\verse His children are far from deliverance, 
and they are crushed in the gate, 
and there is no deliverer—
\verse whose harvest the hungry eats, 
and he takes it \textit{from behind} the thorns; 
and the thirsty pants after their wealth.
\verse Indeed, mischief does not come from the dust, 
and trouble does not sprout from the earth.
\verse But a human being is born to trouble, 
and \textit{they soar aloft} like \textit{sparks}.
\verse “But I myself will seek God, 
and to God I would commit my cause.
\verse He is doing great and \textit{unsearchable} things, 
marvelous things \textit{without number}—
\verse the one who is giving rain on the \textit{surface of} the earth 
and is sending water on the \textit{surface of} the fields,
\verse to set the lowly on high, 
and those mourning are lifted to safety.
\verse He is frustrating the devices of the crafty, 
and their hands do not achieve success.
\verse He is capturing the wise in their craftiness, 
and the schemes of the wily are rushed.
\verse In the daytime they meet with darkness, 
and they grope at noon as in the night.
\verse And he saves from the sword of their mouth, 
\textit{even} the poor from the hand of the strong.
\verse So there is hope for the powerless, 
and wickedness shuts its mouth.
\verse “Look, happy is the human being whom God reproves; 
and you must not despise the discipline of Shaddai,
\verse for he himself wounds, but he binds up; 
he strikes, but his hands heal.
\verse \textit{From} six troubles he will deliver you, 
and in seven evil shall not touch you.
\verse In famine he will redeem you from death, 
and in war from the \textit{power of} the sword.
\verse From the scourge of the tongue you shall be hidden, 
and you shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes.
\verse At destruction and famine you shall laugh, 
and you shall not fear the wild animals of the earth.
\verse For your covenant will be with the stones of the field, 
and the wild animals of the field will be at peace with you.
\verse And you shall know that your tent is safe, 
and you will inspect your fold, and you shall not be missing anything.
\verse And you shall know that your offspring are many, 
and your descendants like the vegetation of the earth.
\verse You shall come in maturity to the grave, 
as the raising up of a stack of sheaves in its season.
\verse “Look, we have searched this out—it is true; 
hear it and know it \textit{yourself}.”

\verseWithHeading{Job’s Second Speech: A Response to Eliphaz}  Then Job answered and said,
\verse “If only my vexation could be well weighed, 
and my calamity could be lifted up together with it in the balances,
\verse for then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; 
therefore my words have been rash,
\verse for the arrows of Shaddai are in me; 
my spirit drinks their poison; 
the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
\verse Does the wild ass bray over grass, 
or the ox bellow over its fodder?
\verse Can tasteless food be eaten without salt, 
or is there taste in the white of a marshmallow plant?
\verse \textit{I refused} to touch them; 
they are like \textit{food that will make me ill}.
\verse “\textit{O that} my request may come, 
and that God may grant my hope,
\verse that God would decide that he would crush me, 
that he would let loose his hand and \textit{kill me}.
\verse But it will still be my consolation, 
and I would recoil in \textit{unrelenting} pain, 
for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
\verse What is my strength, that I should wait? 
And what is my end, that \textit{I should hold out}?
\verse Or is my strength like the strength of stones? 
Or is my flesh bronze?
\verse \textit{Indeed}, my help is not in me, 
and any success is driven from me.
\verse “Loyal love should come for the afflicted from his friend, 
even if he forsakes the fear of Shaddai.
\verse My companions are treacherous like a torrent-bed; 
like a streambed of wadis they flow away,
\verse which are growing dark because of ice upon them, 
it will pile up snow.
\verse In time they dry up, they disappear; 
when it is hot, they vanish from their place.
\verse The paths of their way wind around; 
they go up into the wasteland, and they perish.
\verse The caravans of Tema looked; 
the traveling merchants of Sheba hope for them.
\verse They are disappointed, because they trusted; 
they came \textit{here} and they are confounded.
\verse “For now you have become \textit{such}; 
you see terrors, and you fear.
\verse Is it because I have said, ‘Give to me,’ 
or, ‘Offer a bribe for me from your wealth’?
\verse or, ‘Save me from the foe’s hand,’ 
or, ‘Ransom me from the tyrants’ hand’?
\verse Teach me, and I myself will be silent; 
and make me understand how I have gone astray.
\verse How painful are \textit{upright words}! 
But what does \textit{your reproof} reprove?
\verse Do you intend to reprove my words 
and consider the words of a desperate man as wind?
\verse Even over the orphan you would cast the lot, 
and you would bargain over your friend.
\verse “\textit{Therefore} be prepared, turn to me, 
and I surely will not lie to your face.
\verse Please turn, let no injustice happen; 
indeed, turn, \textit{my righteousness is still intact}.
\verse Is there injustice on my tongue? 
Or can my palate not discern calamity?

\verseWithHeading{Job’s Second Speech: A Response to Eliphaz} “Does not \textit{a human being have hard service} on earth? 
And are not his days like the days of a laborer?
\verse Like a slave he longs for the shadow, 
and like a laborer he waits for his wages.
\verse So \textit{I had to inherit} months of worthlessness, 
and nights of misery are apportioned to me.
\verse When I lie down, I say, ‘When shall I rise?’ 
But the night is long, 
and I have my fill of tossing until dawn.
\verse My body is clothed with maggots and clods of dust; 
my skin hardens, then it gives way again.
\verse “My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, 
and they come to an end \textit{without hope}.
\verse Remember that my life is a breath; 
my eye will not return to see good.
\verse The eye of the one seeing me will not see me; 
your eyes are upon me, but \textit{I will be gone}.
\verse A cloud vanishes, and it goes away, 
so he who goes down to Sheol will not come up.
\verse He does not return again to his house, 
and his place does not recognize him again.
\verse “Even I will not restrain my mouth; 
I will speak in my spirit’s anguish; 
I will complain in my inner self’s bitterness.
\verse Am I the sea, or a sea monster, 
that you set a guard over me?
\verse When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me, 
and my couch will ease my complaint,’
\verse then you terrify me with dreams, 
and with visions you terrify me.
\verse So my inner self will choose strangling— 
death more than my \textit{existence}.
\verse I loathe my life; I would not live forever; 
depart from me, for my days are a breath.
\verse “What is a human being that you make him great 
and that \textit{you fix your mind on him},
\verse so that you visit him \textit{every morning}, 
you test him \textit{every moment}?
\verse \textit{How long} will you not turn away from me? 
Or not leave me alone until I swallow my spit?
\verse If I have sinned, what have I done to you, watcher of humanity? 
Why have you made me as a target for yourself, 
so that I have become a burden to myself?
\verse And why do you not pardon my transgression 
and take away my guilt? 
For now I shall lie in the dust, 
and you will seek me, but \textit{I will be no more}.”

\verseWithHeading{Bildad’s First Response to Job} Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
\verse “\textit{How long} will you say these things, 
and the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?
\verse Does God pervert justice, 
\textit{or} Shaddai pervert righteousness?
\verse If your children sinned against him, 
then he sent them into the \textit{power} of their transgression.
\verse If you yourself would seek God, 
then you would plead to Shaddai for grace.
\verse If you are pure and upright, 
indeed, now he will rouse himself for you, 
and he will restore your righteous abode.
\verse Though your beginning was small, 
your end will be very great.
\verse “Indeed, please inquire of former generations,

Will reeds flourish without water?
\verse While it is in its flower and is not plucked, 
yet it withers \textit{before} all grass.
\verse So are the paths of all who forget God; 
and the hope of the godless will perish,
\verse whose confidence is cut off

\verse He will lean himself against his house, but it will not stand; 
he will take hold of it, but it will not endure.
\verse He is \textit{thriving} \textit{before} the sun,

\verse His roots twine over a stone heap; 
he sees a house of stone.
\verse If he destroys him from his place, 
then it deceives him, saying, ‘I have never seen you.’
\verse Look, this is the joy of his way, 
and from dust others will spring up.
\verse “Look, God will not reject the blameless,

\verse “Truly I know that it is so, 
but how can a human being be just before God?
\verse If he wants to contend with him, 
he cannot answer him one time in a thousand.
\verse He is wise in heart and mighty in strength;

\verse He is the one who made the Bear and Orion, 
the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.
\verse He is the one who does great things \textit{beyond understanding}

How can I choose my words with him,

From my judge I must implore grace.

I do not believe that he will listen to my voice—
\verse who crushes me with a tempest 
and multiplies my wounds without cause.
\verse He will not allow me to \textit{catch} my breath; 
rather, he will fill me with bitterness.
\verse If \textit{it is a matter of} strength, look, he is mighty. 
But if \textit{it is a matter of} justice, who can summon me?
\verse Even though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me; 
even though I am blameless, yet it would pronounce me guilty.

I loathe my life.
\verse It is all one; therefore I say, 
‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’

But if I am righteous, I dare not lift my head; 
I am filled with shame, and just look at my misery!
\verse And if my head grows bold, you would hunt me as the lion in its prime; 
\textit{and you repeat your exploits against me}.
\verse You renew your witnesses against me, 
and you increase your vexation against me; 
\textit{relief forces} are against me.
\verse So why did you bring me forth from the womb? 
I should have passed away, \textit{and no eye should have seen me}.
\verse I should have been as though I had not been; 
I should have been brought from the womb to the grave.
\verse Are not my days few? Let him leave me alone; 
let him turn from me, and let me rejoice a little.

\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 34
\verseWithHeading{Elihu Asserts God’s Justice} Thus Elihu \textit{spoke up} and said,
\verse “Hear my words, you wise men, 
and listen to me, you who know,
\verse for the ear tests words, 
and the palate tastes \textit{food}.
\verse Let us choose justice for ourselves; 
let us determine among ourselves what is good—
\verse for Job has said, ‘I am righteous, 
but God has taken away my justice.
\verse Should I lie concerning my justice? 
Though I am without transgression, my wound caused by an arrow is incurable.’
\verse What man is like Job, 
who drinks scorn like water?
\verse And he goes on the road in company with instigators of mischief, 
and walks with men of wickedness.
\verse Indeed, he says, ‘A man does not profit 
when he takes delight in God.’
\verse “Therefore, listen to me, \textit{people who have sense}: 
far be it from God \textit{that he should commit wickedness} 
and that Shaddai \textit{should do wrong}.
\verse Indeed, he will repay according to a human being’s deeds, 
and according to a man’s way he will let it happen to him.
\verse What’s more, God truly does not act wickedly, 
and Shaddai does not pervert justice.
\verse Who gave him charge over the earth? 
Or who laid on him the whole world?
\verse If he should set his heart to it, 
and he should gather his spirit and his breath to himself,
\verse all flesh would perish together, 
and humankind would return to dust.
\verse “But if you have understanding, hear this; 
listen to \textit{what I say}.
\verse Shall he who hates justice really govern? 
Or will you declare the Righteous One, the Mighty, guilty?—
\verse the one who says to a king, 
‘You worthless man,’ to noblemen, ‘You wicked man,’
\verse who \textit{shows no partiality to officials} 
and who \textit{does not take note of the noble more than of the insignificant}, 
for all of them are the work of his hands?
\verse In a moment they die, 
and in the middle of the night the people are shaken, and they pass away, 
and they take away the mighty \textit{effortlessly}.
\verse “Indeed, his eyes are upon the ways of man, 
and he sees all his steps.
\verse There is no darkness, and there is no deep shadow 
where instigators of mischief might hide themselves.
\verse Indeed, he has not yet appointed a time for man 
to go to God in the judgment.
\verse He shatters the mighty without investigation, 
and he sets others in their place.
\verse Therefore he knows their works, 
and he overturns them in the night 
\textit{so that} they are crushed.
\verse He strikes them \textit{where the wicked stood}, 
\textit{where there are onlookers},
\verse because they have turned aside from him 
and have not understood any of his ways,
\verse so that they cause the cry of distress from the helpless to come to him, 
and he hears the cry of distress from the needy,
\verse but he remains quiet, and who can condemn? 
And he hides his face, and who can behold him? 
Yet he is over a nation and over a person alike,
\verse so that godless human beings should not reign, 
nor those who ensnare the people.
\verse “Indeed, does anyone say to God, ‘I have endured chastisement; 
I will not act corruptly again;
\verse teach me yourself \textit{what I cannot see}; 
if I have done wrong, I will not repeat it’?
\verse \textit{According to your judgment}, must he repay it because you rejected this? 
Indeed, you must choose, and not I, so declare what you know.
\verse \textit{Those who have sense} say to me, 
and the wise man hearing me says:
\verse ‘Job speaks without knowledge, 
and his words are without insight.
\verse Would that Job were tested up to the end 
because his answers are like those from men of mischief,
\verse for he adds transgression to his sin; 
he claps hands among us, 
and he multiplies his words against God.’ ”
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 35
\verseWithHeading{Elihu Condemns Job} Moreover, Elihu \textit{spoke up} and said,
\verse “Do you think this is justice when you say, 
‘\textit{I am right} before God’?
\verse If you ask what it profits you: 
‘How do I benefit \textit{by refraining from my sin}?’
\verse I myself \textit{will give answer to you} 
and to your friends with you.
\verse “Look at the heavens, and see; 
and observe the clouds that are higher than you.
\verse If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him? 
And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?
\verse If you are righteous, what do you give to him, 
or what does he receive from your hand?
\verse Your wickedness affects a person like yourself, 
and your righteousness affects humans.
\verse “Because of the multitude of oppressions, they cry out; 
they cry for help because of the arm of the mighty.
\verse But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker, 
who gives songs in the night,
\verse who teaches us more than the animals of the earth 
and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?’
\verse There they cry out, but he does not answer 
\textit{because of the pride of evildoers}.
\verse “Surely God does not hear an empty plea, 
and Shaddai does not regard it.
\verse \textit{How much less} when you say that you do not see him, 
that the case is \textit{before him}, and you are waiting for him!
\verse But now, because his anger does not punish, 
and he does not acknowledge the transgression at all,
\verse \textit{therefore} Job opens his mouth in empty talk— 
without knowledge he multiplies words.”
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 36
\verseWithHeading{Elihu Extols God’s Greatness} Then Elihu continued and said,
\verse “Bear with me a little longer, and \textit{I will explain},

\verse I will bring my knowledge from far away, 
and I will ascribe righteousness to my maker,
\verse for truly my words are not falsehood; 
one who has perfect knowledge is with you.
\verse Look, God is mighty but does not despise anyone; 
he is mighty and \textit{good in understanding}.
\verse He does not keep the wicked alive 
but grants justice to the afflicted.
\verse He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, 
but he sets them forever with kings on the throne, and they are exalted.
\verse “And if they are tied up with fetters, 
if they are caught in the cords of misery,
\verse then he declares their work to them, 
and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly.
\verse So he opens their ear to the discipline, 
and he commands that they return from mischief.
\verse If they listen and serve him, 
they complete their days in prosperity and their years in pleasantness.
\verse But if they do not listen, they perish by the sword, 
and they pass away without knowledge.
\verse And the godless of heart cherish anger; 
they do not cry for help when he binds them.
\verse \textit{They die in their youth}, 
and their life ends among the male shrine prostitutes.
\verse He delivers the afflicted by his misery, 
and he opens their ears by the adversity.
\verse And what’s more, he allured you \textit{out of distress} 
into a broad place, where in place of it was no constraint; 
and what was set on your table is full of fatness.
\verse But you are obsessed with the judgment of the wicked; 
judgment and justice take hold of you.
\verse Yes, it is wrath, so that it will not incite you into mockery; 
and do not let the ransom’s greatness turn you aside.
\verse Will your cry for help sustain you without distress, 
or all the efforts of your strength?
\verse You must not long for the night, 
to cut off people \textit{in their place}.
\verse Take care, you must not turn to mischief, 
for because of this you have been tried by misery.
\verse “Look, God is exalted in his power; 
who is a teacher like him?
\verse Who has prescribed his way for him? 
Or who says, ‘You have done wrong’?
\verse Remember that you should extol his work, 
of which people have sung.
\verse All human beings have looked on it; 
everyone watches from afar.
\verse “Look, God is exalted, and we do not know him; 
the number of his years is unsearchable.
\verse Indeed, he draws up the drops of water; 
he distills the rain into its mist,
\verse which the clouds pour down; 
they shower abundantly on human beings.
\verse “Moreover, \textit{can anyone understand} the spreading of clouds, 
the thundering of his dwelling place?
\verse Look, he scatters his lightning around him,

\verse Indeed, he judges people by them; 
he gives food \textit{in abundance}.
