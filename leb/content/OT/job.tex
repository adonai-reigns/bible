\verseWithHeading{Job’s Character and Greatness}{There was a man in the land of Uz whose\lnDAT{}name was Job. That\lebnote{Hebrew “And that”}man was blameless and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil.}%
\verse{And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.}%
\verse{Then\lnFQQ{}his livestock came to be seven thousand sheep and goats and three thousand camels and five hundred pairs\lebnote{Hebrew “pair”}of oxen and five hundred female donkeys, and he had very many slaves, and that man was greater than all the people of the east.}%
\verse{And his sons used to go and hold a feast \textit{at each other’s house}\lebnote{“at the house of a man,” or “at the house of each”}on his day, and they would send, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.}%
\verse{\textit{Then when}\lebnote{“And it would happen that,” or “And it would happen when”}the days of the feast had run their course, \textit{Job would send},\lebnote{“and Job would send”}and he would sanctify them. Thus\lnFQQ{}he would arise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of all of them, because Job thought,\lnACX{}“Perhaps my children have sinned and \textit{cursed}\lebnote{“blessed”— negative meaning by context}God in their heart.” This is what Job used to do \textit{all the time}.\lebnote{Or “always”; literally “all the days”}}%
\verse{And it happened \textit{one day}\lnDXP{}\textit{that}\lnFSM{}the sons of God\lebnote{Or “the heavenly beings,” or “the angels”}came to present themselves before Adonai, and Satan\lnHBG{}also came into their midst.}%
\verse{So\lnFQQ{}Adonai said to Satan,\lnHBG{}“From where have you come?” Then\lnFQQ{}Satan\lnHBG{}answered Adonai and said, “From roaming on the earth and from walking about in it.”}%
\verse{So\lnFQQ{}Adonai said to Satan,\lnHBG{}“Have you \textit{considered}\lnHBN{}my servant Job? Indeed,\lebnote{Or “For,” or “Because”}there is no one like him on the earth—a blameless man and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil.”}%
\verse{Then\lnFQQ{}Satan\lnHBG{}answered Adonai and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?}%
\verse{Have you\lebnote{Emphatic personal pronoun could be translated “you yourself”}not put a fence around him and his household and around \textit{all that belongs to him}\lnHBQ{}\textit{on every side}?\lebnote{“from around”}You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock\lebnote{Or “possessions”}has increased in the land.}%
\verse{But,\lnFQQ{}on the other hand, stretch out\lebnote{Or “please”}your hand and touch \textit{all that belongs to him}\lnHBQ{}and see \textit{whether}\lnHBT{}he will \textit{curse}\lebnote{“bless”— negative meaning by context}you to your face.”}%
\verse{So\lnFQQ{}Adonai said to Satan,\lnHBG{}“Look, \textit{all that belongs to him}\lnHBQ{}is in your \textit{power}.\lebnote{“hand”}Only do not stretch out your hand \textit{against}\lebnote{“to,” or “unto”}him.” So\lnFQQ{}Satan\lnHBG{}went out from Adonai’s \textit{presence}.\lnHBZ{}}%
\verseWithHeading{The Adversary’s Attack on Job’s Possessions}{And then there was one day when\lnDZA{}his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother’s house.}%
\verse{And a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the female donkeys were feeding \textit{beside them}.\lebnote{“on their hands”}}%
\verse{Then\lnFQQ{}the Sabeans \textit{attacked},\lebnote{“fell upon them”}and they took them, and they slew the servants \textit{by the edge of the sword}.\lnHCC{}But\lnFQQ{}I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.”}%
\verse{While this one was still speaking, \textit{another}\lnEQB{}came and said, “The fire of God fell from the heavens, and it blazed up against the sheep and goats and against the servants, and it consumed them. But I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.”}%
\verse{While this one was still speaking, \textit{another}\lnEQB{}came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three divisions, and they made a raid on the camels, and they carried them away, and they struck your servants \textit{by the edge of the sword},\lnHCC{}but I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.”}%
\verse{At the time\lebnote{Hebrew “Until”}this one was speaking, \textit{another}\lnEQB{}came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother’s house.}%
\verse{And behold,\lebnote{Or “Look”}a great wind came from across the desert, and it struck the four corners of the house \textit{so that}\lnFSM{}it fell upon the young people, and they died. But I escaped, even I alone, to tell you.”}%
\verse{Then\lnFQQ{}Job arose and tore his outer garment\lebnote{Or “robe”}and shaved his head; \textit{then}\lnDZA{}he fell upon the ground and he worshiped.}%
\verse{Then\lnFQQ{}he said, “Naked I came out from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return there. Adonai gives, and Adonai takes. Let Adonai’s name be blessed.”}%
\verse{In all this, Job did not sin and did not \textit{charge God with wrongdoing}.\lebnote{“give unseemliness to God”}}%

\verse{So\lnFQQ{}Adonai \textit{asked}\lnHCO{}Satan,\lnHBG{}“From where have you come?” And Satan\lnHBG{}answered Adonai and said, “From roaming on the earth and from walking about in it.”}%

And still he persists in his blamelessness \textit{even though}\lnDZA{}you incited me against him to destroy him for nothing.”}%
\verse{Then\lnFQQ{}Satan\lnHBG{}answered him and said, “Skin for skin! All that \textit{that}\lnFOH{}man has he will give for his life.}%
\verse{But stretch out\lebnote{Or “please”}your hand and touch his bones and his flesh, and see \textit{whether}\lnHBT{}he will \textit{curse}\lebnote{“bless”—negative meaning by context}you to your face.”\lebnote{Hebrew “your faces”}}%
\verse{So\lebnote{“And it happened the/one day”}Adonai said to Satan,\lnHBG{}“\textit{All right},\lnFTF{}he is in your \textit{power}.\lebnote{“hand”}Only spare his life.”}%
\verseWithHeading{Job’s Blameless Behavior}{So\lnFQQ{}Satan\lnHBG{}went out from \textit{Adonai’s presence},\lebnote{“the faces of Adonai”}and he inflicted Job with loathsome skin sores from the sole of his foot up to the crown of his head.}%

\verse{Then\lnFQQ{}his wife said to him, “Are you still persisting in your blamelessness? \textit{Curse}\lebnote{“Bless”—negative meaning by context}God and die.”}%
\verse{So\lnFQQ{}he said to her, “You speak like one of the foolish women speaks. Indeed, should we receive the good from God, but\lnABV{}not receive the evil?” In all this, Job did not sin with his lips.}%
\verse{Thus\lnFQQ{}Job’s three friends heard of this calamity that had come upon him. So\lnFQQ{}each set out from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite. And they met\lebnote{Or “they agreed”}together to come to console him and to comfort him.}%
\verse{Thus\lnFQQ{}they lifted up their eyes\lebnote{Or “they gazed”}from afar, but\lnDZA{}they did not recognize him, so\lnDZA{}they raised their voice, and they wept, and each man tore his outer garment\lebnote{Or “robe”}and threw dust on their heads \textit{toward the sky}.\lebnote{Or “in the air”; literally “to the heavens”}}%
\verse{Then\lnFQQ{}they sat with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, but\lnDZA{}no one spoke\lebnote{Or “there was no speaking”}a word to him because they saw that \textit{his}\lnFOH{}suffering was very great.}%

\verse{\lebnote{Job 41:1–34 in the English Bible is 40:25–41:26 in the Hebrew Bible}“Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook? 
Or\lnFQQ{}\textit{can you tie down its mouth with a cord}?\lebnote{“with a cord can you press down its tongue”}}%
\verse{Can you put a rope in its nose? 
Or\lnFQQ{}can you pierce its jawbone with a hook?}%
\verse{Will it make numerous pleas for mercy to you? 
Or will it speak gentle words to you?}%
\verse{Will it make a covenant with you? 
Will you take it as a slave forever?}%
\verse{Will you play with it as with birds 
and put it on a leash for your girls?}%
\verse{Will guildsmen bargain over it? 
Will they divide it between tradesmen?}%
\verse{Can you fill its kin with harpoons 
or\lnDZA{}its head with fish spears?}%
\verse{Lay your hands on it; 
think about the battle—you will not do it again!}%
\verse{“Look, \textit{the hope of capturing it}\lebnote{“its hope”}is false. 
Will one be hurled down even at its sight?}%
\verse{Is it not fierce when somebody stirs it? 
Who then is he who would stand \textit{before it}?\lebnote{Or “Who is he thenwho could stand before me?”; literally “to the face of me”}}%
\verse{Who has come to confront me, that\lnDZA{}I should repay him? 
Under all the heavens, \textit{it belongs to me}.\lebnote{“to me”}}%
\verse{“I will not keep quiet concerning its limbs 
or\lnDZA{}concerning the extent of its might and the gracefulness of its frame.}%
\verse{Who can strip off \textit{its outer covering}?\lebnote{“the surface of its garment”}
Who can penetrate its double harness?}%
\verse{Who can open the doors of its face? 
Its teeth all around are fearsome.}%
\verse{Its back\lebnote{LXX; or “pride”}has scales of shields; 
it is shut up closely as with a seal.}%
\verse{They are close \textit{to one another}—\lnAXP{}
even\lnDZA{}the air cannot come between them.}%
\verse{They are joined \textit{one to another};\lebnote{“a man to his brother”}
they cling together and cannot be separated.}%
\verse{“Its snorting flashes forth light, 
and its eyes are \textit{red like dawn}.\lebnote{“like eyelids of dawn”}}%
\verse{Torches go from its mouth; 
sparks of fire shoot out.}%
\verse{Smoke comes from its nostrils 
as from a kettle boiling and burning bulrushes.}%
\verse{Its breath kindles charcoal, 
and a flame comes from its mouth.}%
\verse{“Strength abides in its neck, 
and dismay\lebnote{Or “strength”}dances \textit{before it}.\lebnote{“to the face of him/it”}}%
\verse{Its flesh’s folds of skin cling together; 
it is cast on it—it will not be moved.}%
\verse{Its heart is cast as stone; 
yes,\lnDZA{}it is cast as the lower millstone.}%
\verse{\textit{When it raises itself},\lebnote{“From his/its rising up”}the mighty ones are terrified; 
they retreat because of its thrashing.}%
\verse{Reaching it with the sword does not avail, 
nor with the spear, the dart, or\lnDZA{}the javelin.}%
\verse{It regards iron as straw, 
bronze as rotten wood.}%
\verse{\textit{An arrow}\lebnote{“A son of a bow”}will not make it flee; 
sling stones are turned to stubble for it.}%
\verse{Clubs are regarded as stubble, 
and it laughs at the short sword’s rattle.}%
\verse{“Its underparts are shards of a potsherd; 
it moves over mud like a threshing sledge.}%
\verse{It makes the deep boil like a cooking pot; 
it makes the sea like a pot of ointment.}%
\verse{Behind it, \textit{it leaves a glistening wake};\lebnote{“it lights up the path”}
one would think that the deep has gray hair.}%
\verse{“\textit{On the ground it has no equal}\lebnote{“There is not on the ground its likeness”}— 
a\lnBBD{}creature without fear.}%
\verse{It observes all the lofty; 
it is king \textit{over all that are proud}.”\lebnote{“over all sons of pride”}}%

\begin{biblechapter} % Job 42
\verseWithHeading{Job’s Repentance and Restoration}{Then\lnFQQ{}Job answered Adonai and said,}%
\verse{“I know that you can do all things, 
and any scheme from you will not be thwarted.}%
\verse{‘Who is this darkening counsel without knowledge?’ 
Therefore I uttered, but\lnDZA{}I did not understand; 
\textit{things too wonderful for me},\lebnote{“wonderful things from me”}but I did not know.}%
\verse{‘Hear and I will speak; 
I will question you, then\lnDZA{}inform me.’}%
\verse{By the ear’s hearing I heard of you, 
but\lnDZA{}now my eye has seen you.}%
\verse{Therefore I despise myself 
and repent in dust and ashes.”}%
\verse{\textit{And then}\lnDXN{}after Adonai spoke these words to Job, Adonai said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “\textit{My wrath has been kindled}\lebnote{“My nose became hot”}against you\lnBLI{}and against the two of your friends, for you\lnARS{}have not spoken to me what is right as my servant Job has.}%
\verse{\textit{So then},\lebnote{Or “And now,” or “Therefore”}take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job will pray for you,\lnARS{}for \textit{I will certainly accept his prayer},\lebnote{“if his face I will lift up,” or “indeed his face I will lift up” (“if” used as an oath particle)}so that it will not be done with you\lnARS{}according to your folly, for you\lnARS{}have not spoken to me what is right as my servant Job has.”}%
\verse{So\lnFQQ{}Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did just as Adonai had told them, and \textit{Adonai accepted Job’s prayer}.\lebnote{“Adonai lifted up the face of Job”}}%
\verse{Then\lnFQQ{}Adonai returned Job’s fortune when he prayed to him on behalf of his friends. Thus\lnFQQ{}Adonai increased \textit{all that Job had twice as much as before}.\lebnote{“all which for Job to twice”}}%
\verse{So\lnFQQ{}all his brothers and all his sisters and all those who had known him \textit{before}\lebnote{“to faces”}came to him, and they ate bread\lebnote{Or “food”}with him in his house and showed sympathy to him and comforted him for all the disaster\lnFHR{}that Adonai had brought upon him. Then\lnFQQ{}each one gave to him one piece of money, and each one gave to him one ornamental ring of gold.}%
\verse{So\lnFQQ{}Adonai blessed Job’s latter days more than his beginning. \textit{Thus he had}\lnHSV{}fourteen thousand sheep and goats and six thousand camels and a thousand pair of oxen and a thousand female donkeys.}%
\verse{\textit{And he had}\lnHSV{}seven sons and three daughters.}%
\verse{And he called the name of the first Jemimah and the name of the second Keziah and the name of the third Qeren-Happuk.}%
\verse{And beautiful women were not found in all the land like Job’s daughters, and their father gave to them an inheritance in the midst of their brothers.}%
\verse{And Job lived after this one hundred and forty years, and he saw his sons and his \textit{grandsons}\lebnote{“the sons of his sons”}for four generations.}%
\verse{Then\lnFQQ{}Job died old and full of days.}%
