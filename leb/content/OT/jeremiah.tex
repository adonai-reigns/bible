\begin{biblechapter} % Jeremiah 1
\verseWithHeading{Adonai Appoints Jeremiah as a Prophet to the Nations} The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, among the priests who \textit{were} in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin,
\verse \textit{to} whom the word of Adonai came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, the king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
\verse It came also in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
\verse And the word of Adonai came to me, \textit{saying},
\verse “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, 
and before you came out from \textit{the} womb I consecrated you; 
I appointed you \textit{as} a prophet to the nations.”
\verse Then I said, “Ah, Lord Adonai! Look, I do not know \textit{how} to speak, for I \textit{am} a youth.”
\verse But Adonai said to me, “You must not say, ‘I \textit{am} a youth,’ for to \textit{whomever} I send you, you will go, and \textit{whatever} I command you, you will speak.
\verse \textit{Do not be afraid of them}, for I \textit{am} with you to deliver you,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse Then Adonai stretched out his hand and he touched my mouth, and Adonai said to me,
\verse “Look, I have put my words in your mouth.
\verseWithHeading{Adonai Confirms Jeremiah’s Call} And the word of Adonai came to me, \textit{saying}, “What \textit{are} you seeing, Jeremiah?” And I said, “I \textit{am} seeing a branch of an almond tree.”
\verse Then Adonai said to me, “You did well to see, for I \textit{am} watching over my word to perform it.”
\verse And the word of Adonai came to me a second \textit{time}, \textit{saying}, “What \textit{are} you seeing?” And I said, “I \textit{am} seeing a \textit{boiling} pot, and its face \textit{is} from \textit{the} face of \textit{the} north.”
\verse Then Adonai said to me, “From \textit{the} north disaster will be unleashed on all the inhabitants of the land.
\verse For, look, I \textit{am} calling to all \textit{the} clans of \textit{the} kingdoms of \textit{the} north,” \textit{declares} Adonai, “and they will come and set each one his throne \textit{at} the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its surrounding walls, and against all the cities of Judah.
\verse And I will pass my judgments on them because of all their wickedness \textit{in} that they have forsaken me, and they made sacrifices to other gods, and they bowed in worship to the works of their hands.
\verse But you, you must gird your loins, and stand, and speak to them all that I command you. \textit{Do not be afraid of them}, or I will shatter you \textit{before} them.
\verse Now look, I have made you \textit{today} as a fortified city and as an iron pillar and a bronze wall against all the land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.
\verse And they will fight against you but they will not prevail against you, for I \textit{am} with you,” \textit{declares} Adonai, “to deliver you.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Jeremiah 2
\verseWithHeading{Adonai Remembers Israel’s Faithfulness} And the word of Adonai came to me, \textit{saying},
\verse “Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, \textit{saying}, ‘Thus says Adonai,
\verse “I remember \textit{concerning} you the loyal love of your childhood, 
the love of your betrothal-time, 
your going after me in the desert, 
in \textit{the} land not sown.
\verseWithHeading{The Unfaithfulness of Israel’s Ancestors} Hear the word of Adonai, \textit{O} house of Jacob, and all the clans of the house of Israel.
\verse Thus says Adonai:
\verse “What injustice did your ancestors find in me 
that they were far from me, 
and they went after the vanity, 
and they became vain?
\verse And they did not say, 
‘Where \textit{is} Adonai, 
the one who brought us up from the land of Egypt, 
the one who led us in the desert, 
in a land of desert plains and gorges, 
in a land of dryness and deep darkness, 
in a land \textit{that no one passes through}, 
and no human lives there?’
\verse And I brought you to the land of the orchard, 
to eat its fruit, and its good things. 
But you entered and defiled my land, 
and my inheritance you made a detestable thing.
\verseWithHeading{The Unfaithfulness of Contemporary Israel} \textit{Therefore} I again bring a lawsuit against you,” \textit{declares} Adonai, 
“and with \textit{your children} I bring a lawsuit.
\verse For go over \textit{to} the coasts of Cyprus and look, 
and send \textit{to} Kedar and consider very closely, 
and see if there has been \textit{a thing} like this:
\verse Has a nation exchanged gods? And they \textit{are} not gods! 
But my people have exchanged their glory for that which does not profit.
\verse Be appalled, \textit{O} heavens, at this, and shudder; 
be utterly desolate,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “For my people have committed two evils: 
they have forsaken me, \textit{the} source of living water, 
to hew out for themselves cisterns, cracked cisterns that can hold no water.
\verse \textit{Is} Israel a slave? Or \textit{a slave born in a house}? 
Why has he become plunder?
\verse \textit{The} young lions have roared against him, 
they have \textit{raised} their voices. 
And they have made his land as horror; 
his cities are destroyed, \textit{without} an inhabitant.
\verse Moreover, people of Memphis and Tahpanhes 
will \textit{shave} your skull.
\verse Did you not do this to yourself, 
\textit{by} forsaking Adonai, your God, 
at the time of your leading in the way?
\verse And now \textit{why do you go} the way of Egypt 
to drink the waters of the Shihor? 
And \textit{why do you go} the way of Assyria 
to drink the waters of the \textit{Euphrates}?
\verse Your wickedness will chastise you, 
and your apostasies will reprove you. 
Therefore know and see that \textit{it is} evil and bitter, 
your forsaking of Adonai, your God, 
and fear of me \textit{is} not in you,” 
\textit{declares} the Lord, Adonai of hosts.
\verse “For from long ago you have broken your yoke, 
you tore to pieces your bonds. 
And you said, ‘I will not serve!’ 
But on every high hill and under every leafy tree 
you \textit{were} lying down \textit{as} a prostitute.
\verse Yet I planted you \textit{as} a choice vine, 
all of it a seed of trustworthiness. 
How then have you altered before me 
\textit{into something that is} degenerate, the foreign vine?
\verse For if you wash with natron, 
and you \textit{use much soap}, 
your guilt \textit{is} sticking as a stain \textit{before} me,” 
\textit{declares} the Lord Adonai.
\verse “How can you say, ‘I have not defiled myself, 
I have not gone after the Baals?’ 
Look at your way in the valley, 
know what you have done. 
\textit{You are} a young she-camel, 
interweaving her ways.
\verse A wild ass accustomed to \textit{the} desert, 
in the desire of her soul. 
She gasps \textit{for} wind \textit{in} her rutting time. 
Who can quell her \textit{lust}? 
All \textit{those who} seek her will not grow weary, 
in her month they will find her.
\verse Restrain your foot from \textit{being} barefoot, 
and your throat from thirst. 
But you said, ‘\textit{It is} hopeless. 
No! For I have loved strangers, 
and after them I will go.’
\verse As \textit{the} shame of a thief when he is caught in the act, 
so the house of Israel will be ashamed. 
They, their kings, their officials, 
and their priests, and their prophets.
\verse \textit{Those who} say to the tree, ‘You \textit{are} my father,’ 
and to the stone, ‘You gave birth \textit{to} me.’ 
For they have turned \textit{their} \textit{backs} to me, and not \textit{their} faces. 
But in the time of their trouble they say, ‘Arise and save us.’
\verse But where \textit{are} your gods that you made for yourself? 
Let them arise if they can save you in the time of your trouble. 
For \textit{according to} the number of your towns 
are your gods, \textit{O} Judah.
\verse Why do you complain to me? 
All of you have \textit{rebelled against me},” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “For \textit{in vain} I have struck your children. 
They accepted no discipline. 
Your sword devoured your prophets, 
like a ravening lion.
\verse O generation, you see the word of Adonai. 
Have I been a desert to Israel? Or a land of great darkness? 
Why do my people say, ‘We roam about freely, 
we will not come again to you’?
\verse Can a young woman forget her ornaments? \textit{Or} a bride her sashes? 
Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
\verse How well you do \textit{on} your way to seek love! 
\textit{Therefore} even \textit{to} the wicked \textit{woman} you can teach your ways.
\verse Also on your skirts is found 
\textit{the} blood of \textit{the} life of \textit{the} innocent, \textit{the} poor. 
You did not find them in the act of breaking into a house. 
But in spite of all these \textit{things},
\verse yet you say, ‘But I am innocent, 
surely his anger has turned away from me.’ 
Look, I \textit{am} entering into judgment with you 
because of your saying, ‘I have not sinned.’
\verse How you go about so much changing your way! 
Also by Egypt you will be put to shame, 
just as you were put to shame by Assyria.
\verse Also from there you will come out 
with your hands on your head, 
for Adonai has rejected \textit{those in whom you trust}, 
and you will not prosper through them.

\begin{biblechapter} % Jeremiah 3
\verse A \textit{saying}: ‘Look, \textit{if} a man divorces his wife, 
and she goes from him \textit{and she becomes another man’s wife}, 
will he return to her again?’ 
Will not that land be greatly defiled? 
And you have prostituted \textit{yourself} \textit{with} many lovers, 
\textit{would} you now return to me?” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “Lift up your eyes at \textit{the} barren heights, 
and see where you have not been ravished. 
Beside the roads you sat for them like an Arab in the desert, 
and you have defiled \textit{the} land 
with your fornication 
and with your wickedness.
\verse Therefore rain showers have been withheld, 
and the spring rain has not come. 
Yet \textit{you have} \textit{the} forehead of a woman prostitute, 
you refuse to be ashamed.
\verse Have you not just now called to me, 
‘My father, you \textit{are} the close friend of my youth?
\verse Will he be angry \textit{forever}? 
Will he maintain \textit{it} \textit{always}’? 
Look, you have spoken, 
but you have done all the evil that you could.”
\verseWithHeading{Adonai Gives Israel a Letter of Divorce} Then Adonai said to me in the days of Josiah, the king, “Have you seen what apostate Israel has done? She has gone on every high hill and under every leafy tree and she has prostituted \textit{herself} there.
\verse And I thought, ‘After her doing all these \textit{things} to me she will return,’ but she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw \textit{it}.
\verse And I saw that \textit{for this very reason, that} on account of apostate Israel committing adultery I divorced her and gave the letter of divorce to her. Yet her treacherous sister Judah was not afraid and she went and prostituted \textit{herself} also.
\verse And it was because of the frivolity of her fornication that she defiled the land and committed adultery with the stone and with the tree.
\verse Yet even in all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, \textit{but only} in pretense,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verseWithHeading{A Call for Repentance} Then Adonai said to me, “Apostate Israel has proved herself more upright than treacherous Judah.
\verse Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say,
\verse ‘Return, apostate Israel,’ \textit{declares} Adonai. 
‘I will not cause my \textit{anger} to fall on you. 
For I \textit{am} loyal,’ \textit{declares} Adonai. 
‘I will not be angry \textit{forever}.
\verse “Return, apostate children,” \textit{declares} Adonai. “For \textit{I am your master}, and I will take you one from a city and two from a clan, and I will bring you \textit{to} Zion.
\verse Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart and they will feed you knowledge and insight.
\verse And it will be when you have multiplied and become fruitful in the land in those days,” \textit{declares} Adonai, “they will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant of Adonai.’ And \textit{it will not come to mind}, nor will they remember it, nor will they miss \textit{it}, nor will it be made again.
\verse At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘The Throne of Adonai,’ and all the nations will be gathered to it, to the name of Adonai, to Jerusalem, and they will no longer go after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
\verse In those days the house of Judah will walk along with the house of Israel and they will come together from \textit{the} land of \textit{the} north to the land that I gave as an inheritance \textit{to} your ancestors.
\verse Then I thought, ‘How I would set you among the children, 
and I would give you a land of desire, 
an inheritance of \textit{the} glory of \textit{the} hosts of nations.’ 
And I thought, ‘You would call me, “My father,” 
and you would not turn back from \textit{behind} me.’
\verse However, as a wife departs treacherously from her lover, 
so you have dealt treacherously with me, 
\textit{O} house of Israel,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “A voice \textit{is} heard on \textit{the} barren heights, 
the weeping of the pleas for mercy of the children of Israel, 
because they have perverted their way, 
they have forgotten Adonai their God.
\verse Return, \textit{O} apostate children, 
I will heal your backsliding. 
‘Look, we come to you, 
for you are Adonai our God.
\verse Surely, an illusion \textit{comes} from \textit{the} hills, 
\textit{the} turmoil \textit{on} the mountains. 
Surely, in Adonai our God 
\textit{is} the salvation of Israel.
\verse But the shameful thing has devoured 
the labor of our ancestors from our youth, 
their flocks, and their cattle, 
their sons and their daughters.
\verse Let us lie down in our shame, 
and let our disgrace cover us. 
For against Adonai our God we have sinned, 
we and our ancestors, 
from our youth and until this day. 
and we have not obeyed the voice of Adonai our God.’

\begin{biblechapter} % Jeremiah 4
\verse If you return, \textit{O} Israel,” \textit{declares} Adonai, 
“you return to me. 
And if you remove your abominations from my \textit{presence}, 
and you do not wander,
\verse and you swear, ‘\textit{As Adonai lives},’ 
in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, 
then nations will be blessed by him, 
and in him they will boast.”
\verse For thus says Adonai 
to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, 
“Break up for yourselves prepared virgin soil, 
and you must not sow among thornbushes.
\verse Circumcise yourselves to Adonai, 
and remove the foreskins of your hearts, 
men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
lest my wrath goes forth like the fire and burns, 
and there is no \textit{one who} extinguishes \textit{it}, 
because of the evil of your deeds.”
\verseWithHeading{An Invasion from the North} Declare in Judah and proclaim in Jerusalem and say, 
“Blow a horn through the land, 
\textit{call with a loud voice} and say, 
‘Be gathered and let us go into the fortified cities.’
\verse Lift up a signal toward Zion, 
bring yourselves to safety; you must not remain standing, 
for I \textit{am} bringing evil from \textit{the} north, 
and a great destruction.
\verse A lion has gone up from his thicket, 
and a destroyer of nations has set out. 
He has gone out from his place to make your land as a horror, 
your cities will go to ruin \textit{without} inhabitant.
\verse Because of this gird yourselves \textit{with} sackcloth, lament and wail, 
for \textit{the burning anger} of Adonai has not turned back from us.
\verse And then on that day,” \textit{declares} Adonai, 
“the heart of the king and the heart of the officials will be destroyed, 
and the priests will be appalled, 
and the prophets will be astonished.”
\verse Then I said, “Ah, Lord Adonai, surely you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘It will be peace for you,’ while the sword reaches up to the throat.”
\verse At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, 
“\textit{A hot wind from the barren heights} in the desert, 
\textit{in the direction of} the daughter of my people, 
not to winnow and not to cleanse,
\verse \textit{a wind too strong for} these will come for me, 
now also I speak judgments against them.”
\verse Look, he comes up like the clouds, 
and his chariots \textit{are} like the whirlwind, 
his horses are swifter than eagles, 
woe to us, for we are devastated.
\verse Cleanse your heart from wickedness, \textit{O} Jerusalem, 
so that you may be saved. 
\textit{How long} will your thoughts of mischief 
dwell in your inner part?
\verse For a voice \textit{is} declaring from Dan, 
and \textit{is} proclaiming disaster from the mountain of Ephraim.
\verse “Report to the nations, ‘Here they are!’ 
Proclaim against Jerusalem, 
‘Besiegers \textit{are} coming \textit{from a distant land}, 
and they raise their voice against the cities of Judah.’
\verse Like watchers of a field they were against her from all around, 
because she has rebelled against me,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “You obtained this for yourself 
\textit{because of} your way and your deeds. 
This \textit{is} your doom, for \textit{it is} bitter, 
yes, it has reached up to your heart.”
\verse My bowels, my bowels! I writhe! 
The walls of my heart! 
My heart is restless within me, I cannot keep silent, 
for I hear \textit{in} my inner self the sound of a horn, \textit{the} alarm of war.
\verse Destruction on destruction is proclaimed, 
for all of the land is devastated. 
Suddenly my tents are devastated, 
my tent curtains in a moment.
\verse How long must I see \textit{the} banner, 
\textit{and} hear \textit{the} sound of a horn?
\verse “For my people \textit{are} foolish, 
they have not known me. 
They \textit{are} foolish children, 
and they do not have insight. 
They \textit{are} skillful at doing evil, 
and they do not know \textit{how} to do good.”
\verse I looked at the earth, and behold, it was wasteland and emptiness, 
and to the heavens, and \textit{they were} without their light.
\verse I looked at the mountains, and behold, they were quaking, 
and all of the hills were jolted to and fro.
\verse I looked and behold, there was no person, 
and all of the birds of the sky had fled.
\verse I looked and behold, the fruitful land \textit{was} a desert, 
and all of its cities were ruined before Adonai, 
before the face of \textit{his burning anger}.
\verse For thus says Adonai, “All of the land will be a desolation, 
yet I will not make a complete desolation.
\verse Because of this the earth will mourn, 
and the heavens above will become dark. 
Because I have spoken, I have planned, 
and I have not relented, and I will not turn back from it.”
\verse From the sound of a horseman and \textit{an archer} every town flees, 
they enter in the thickets and among the rocks they climb. 
Every town \textit{is} forsaken, 
and there is no person \textit{who} lives in them.
\verse And you, \textit{O} devastated one, what \textit{do} you do, 
that you put on crimson, 
that you adorn yourself \textit{with} ornaments of gold, 
that you make your eyes look bigger with the eye make-up? 
In vain you beautify yourself. 
\textit{Your} lovers reject you; 
they seek your life.
\verse For I heard a voice like an ill woman, 
anxiety like \textit{a woman who} bears her first child, 
the voice of the daughter of Zion. 
She is gasping for breath, 
she is spreading out her hands: 
“Woe is me, for I am becoming tired before killers.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Jeremiah 5
\verse “Roam about through the streets of Jerusalem, 
and look please, and take note, 
and search at its public squares, 
if you can find a person \textit{who} does justice, 
\textit{who} seeks honesty, 
so that I may forgive it.
\verse And though they say, ‘\textit{As Adonai lives},’ 
\textit{therefore} they swear falsely.”
\verse \textit{O} Adonai, do not your eyes \textit{look} for honesty? 
You have struck them, but they felt no pain, 
you have destroyed them, they refused to take discipline. 
They have hardened their faces more than rock, 
they have refused to turn back.
\verse Then I said, “\textit{They are} just simple people, 
they are foolish, 
for they know not the way of Adonai, 
the law of their God.
\verse Let me go to the great, 
and let me speak with them, 
for they know the way of Adonai, 
the law of their God.” 
However, they together have broken \textit{the} yoke, 
they have torn to pieces \textit{the} bonds.
\verse Therefore a lion from \textit{the} forest will kill them, 
A wolf \textit{from the} desert plains will devastate them. 
A leopard \textit{is} watching their cities, 
everyone \textit{who} goes out from there will be torn, 
because their transgressions are many, 
their apostasies are numerous.
\verse “\textit{How} can I forgive you? 
Your children have forsaken me, 
and they have sworn by \textit{those who are} not gods. 
But I fed them to the full, 
and they committed adultery, 
and flocked \textit{to} the house of a prostitute.
\verse They were well-fed lusty horses, 
they neighed each to the wife of his neighbor.
\verse Because of these \textit{things} shall I not punish?” \textit{declares} Adonai, 
“and on a nation who \textit{is} like this, shall I not take revenge?
\verse Go up through her vineyards and destroy, 
but you must not make complete destruction. 
Remove her branches, 
for they \textit{are} not to Adonai.
\verse For the house of Israel and the house of Judah 
have dealt utterly treacherously with me,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “They have denied Adonai, and have said, 
‘Not he, \textit{for} evil will not come on us, 
we will see neither sword nor famine.
\verse And the prophets are like wind, 
and the word \textit{is} not in them.’ 
Thus it will be done to them.”
\verse \textit{Therefore} thus says Adonai, the God of hosts, 
“Because you have spoken this word, 
look, I \textit{am} making my words in your mouth like a fire, 
and this people wood, and it will devour them.
\verse Look, I \textit{am} about to bring on you a nation from afar, 
\textit{O} house of Israel,” \textit{declares} Adonai. 
“It \textit{is} an enduring nation, it \textit{is} \textit{an ancient nation}. 
A nation whose language you do not know, 
and you cannot understand what they speak.
\verse Their quiver \textit{is} like an open tomb, 
all of them \textit{are} warriors.
\verse And they will eat your harvest and your food, 
they will eat your sons and your daughters, 
they will eat your flock and your herd, 
they will eat your vine and your fig tree, 
they will smash with the sword \textit{your fortified cities}, 
in which you trust.
\verse “But even in those days,” \textit{declares} Adonai, “I will not make you a complete destruction.
\verse \textit{And then}, when you \textit{people} say, ‘Why has Adonai our God done all of these \textit{things} to us?’ Then you will say to them, ‘As you have forsaken me and have served gods of a foreign land in your land, so will you serve strangers in \textit{a land that does not belong to you}.’
\verse “Declare this in the house of Jacob, 
and proclaim it in Judah, saying,
\verse ‘Hear this please, \textit{O} foolish and \textit{senseless} people, 
\textit{who have eyes} but do not see, 
\textit{who have ears} but do not hear.’
\verse Do you not revere me?” \textit{declares} Adonai, 
“Do you not tremble \textit{before me}? 
For I have placed \textit{the} sand \textit{as} a boundary for the sea, 
\textit{as an everlasting limit}, and it cannot pass over it, 
and they rise and fall loudly, but they cannot prevail, 
and its waves roar, but they cannot pass over it.
\verse But for this people is a stubborn and rebellious heart, 
they have turned aside and have gone \textit{away}.
\verse And they do not say in their hearts, 
‘Let us fear please Adonai our God, 
the \textit{one who} gives \textit{the} autumn rain and \textit{the} spring rain in its season, 
\textit{the set times of the harvest} he keeps for us.’
\verse Your iniquities have disturbed these, 
and your sins have kept away the good from you.
\verse For wicked people are found among my people, 
they lie in wait like the hiding of fowlers, 
they set up a trap, 
they catch humans.
\verse Like a cage full of birds, 
so their houses \textit{are} full of fraud. 
\textit{Therefore} they have become great, 
and they have become rich.
\verse They have grown fat, 
they have grown sleek, 
also, \textit{their evil deeds have no limit}. 
They do not judge \textit{with} justice, 
\textit{the} legal cause of \textit{the} orphan, 
or allow it to succeed, 
and \textit{the} legal case of \textit{the} poor, 
they do not defend.
\verse Because of these \textit{things} shall I not punish?” \textit{declares} Adonai, 
“and on a nation who \textit{is} like this, shall I not take revenge?
\verse A horrific event and something horrible has happened in the land.
\verse The prophets prophesy \textit{falsely}, 
and the priests rule \textit{by their own authority}, 
and my people love \textit{it} so much. 
But what will you do \textit{when the end comes}?

\verse Flee for safety, \textit{O} children of Benjamin, 
from the midst of Jerusalem. 
And in Tekoa blow a horn, 
and on Beth-haccherem lift up a signal, 
for evil looks down from \textit{the} north, 
and a great destruction.
\verse The lovely and the delicate, 
the daughter of Jerusalem, I will destroy.
\verse Shepherds and their flocks will come against her, 
they will pitch \textit{their} tents against her all around, 
they will pasture, each his \textit{portion}.
\verse \textit{Sanctify} war against her. 
Arise, and let us attack at noon. 
Woe to us, for the day turns, 
for \textit{the} shadows of evening are lengthened.
\verse Arise, and let us attack by night, 
and let us destroy her citadel fortresses.”
\verse For thus says Adonai of hosts, 
“Cut down trees and heap up a siege ramp against Jerusalem. 
This \textit{is} the city that must be punished, 
its oppression \textit{is} in its midst.
\verse As a water well keeps its water cool, 
so she keeps cool her wickedness. 
Violence and destruction are heard within her, 
sickness and wounds \textit{are} continually \textit{before me}.
\verse Be warned, \textit{O} Jerusalem, 
lest I turn away from you in disgust, 
lest I make you a desolation, 
a land that is not inhabited.”
\verse Thus says Adonai of hosts: 
“They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine, 
turn back your hand over \textit{the} branches like a grape-gatherer.
\verse To whom shall I speak and admonish, 
that they may hear? 
Look, their ears \textit{are} \textit{closed}, 
and they are not able to listen attentively. 
Look, the word of Adonai is to them an object of scorn, 
they do not delight in it.
\verse But I am full with the wrath of Adonai, 
I struggle to hold \textit{it} in. 
Pour \textit{it} out on \textit{the} children in the street, 
and on the assemblies of young men at the same time. 
For even husband with wife will get trapped, 
\textit{the} old with \textit{him who is} full of days.
\verse And their houses will be turned over to others, 
\textit{their} fields and \textit{their} wives together. 
For I will stretch out my hand 
against the inhabitants of the land,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “For from the smallest of them to the greatest of them, 
\textit{everyone} makes profit for unlawful gain. 
And from the prophet to the priest, 
\textit{everyone} practices deceit.
\verse And they have treated the wound of my people lightly, 
\textit{saying}, ‘Peace, peace,’ but there is no peace.
\verse Have they acted ashamed, for they have committed a detestable thing? 
Not at all, nor were they ashamed; they did not know to feel humiliated. 
\textit{Therefore} they will fall among \textit{those who} fall at the time I punish them, 
they will stumble,” says Adonai.
\verse Thus says Adonai: “Stand at \textit{the} roads and look,

But they said, ‘We will not walk \textit{in it}.’
\verse And I raised up watchmen over you: 
‘Listen attentively to \textit{the} sound of a horn.’ 
But they said, ‘We will not listen attentively.’
\verse \textit{Therefore} hear, O nations, and know, \textit{O} community, 
\textit{what will happen to them}.
\verse Hear, O earth, 
look, I \textit{am} about to bring disaster to this people, 
the fruit of their plans, 
because they have not listened attentively to my words, 
and my teaching, they have rejected it also.
\verse What \textit{is} this to me? 
Frankincense comes from Sheba, 
and the precious spice reed from a distant land. 
Your burnt offerings \textit{are} not \textit{acceptable}, 
your sacrifices are not pleasing to me.”
\verse \textit{Therefore} thus says Adonai: 
“Look, I \textit{am} about to put before this people stumbling blocks, 
and they will stumble against them, 
fathers and children together, 
neighbor and his friend will perish.”
\verse Thus says Adonai: 
“Look, a people \textit{is} coming from \textit{the} land of \textit{the} north, 
a great nation is woken up from \textit{the} farthest part of \textit{the} earth.
\verse \textit{The} bow and \textit{the} short sword they grasp \textit{are} cruel, 
and they show no mercy. 
Their sound roars like the sea, and on horses they ride, 
drawn up like a man for battle against you, O daughter of Zion.”
\verse We have heard news of it, 
our hands grow slack, 
anxiety has grasped us, 
pain as a \textit{woman who} gives birth.
\verse You must not go out \textit{into} the field, 
and you must not walk on the road, 
for \textit{the enemy has a sword}, 
terror \textit{is} all around.
\verse O daughter of my people, 
gird yourself \textit{with} sackcloth, 
and roll about in the ashes in mourning, 
a mourning ceremony \textit{as for} an only child. 
Make for yourself wailing of bitterness, 
for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.
\verse “I have made you an assayer among my people, a fortification, 
so that you may know and put to the test their ways.
\verse All of them \textit{are} stubborn rebels, 
going about \textit{talking} slander. 
\textit{They are} bronze and iron, 
they \textit{are} all behaving corruptly.
\verse \textit{The} bellows are burned up, 
lead is consumed by fire. 
\textit{In vain} \textit{he keeps on refining}, 
but \textit{the} wicked are not torn apart.

\verse For even your relatives, and the house of your father, 
even they have dealt treacherously with you, 
even they call \textit{loudly} after you. 
You must not trust in them, though they speak kindly to you.
\verse I have forsaken my house, I have abandoned my inheritance. 
I have given the beloved one of my \textit{heart} into the hand of her enemies.
\verse My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest. 
She has lifted up against me her voice; \textit{therefore} I hate her.
\verse The lair of \textit{the} hyena \textit{is} my inheritance to me, 
the birds of prey \textit{are} all around her. 
Go, gather all of the animals of the field, 
bring \textit{them} \textit{to come and devour}.
\verse Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, 
they have trampled down my plot of land. 
They have made \textit{my pleasant field} 
like the desert of desolation.
\verse They have made it a desolation. 
Desolate, it mourns to me. 
All the land is made desolate, 
but there is no person taking \textit{it} to heart.
\verse Upon all \textit{the} barren heights in the desert destroyers have come, 
for \textit{the} sword of Adonai devours, 
from \textit{one} end of \textit{the} land to the \textit{other} end of the land, 
there is no peace for all flesh.
\verse They have sown wheat and they have reaped thorns. 
They are exhausted, they do not profit. 
And they will be ashamed of your produce, 
because of \textit{the burning anger} of Adonai.”
\verse Thus says Adonai concerning all of the evil neighbors who touch the inheritance that I gave as an inheritance \textit{to} my people Israel: “Look, I \textit{am} about to drive them out from their land, and the house of Judah I will drive out from among them.
\verse \textit{And then} after my driving them out, I will once again have compassion on them, and I will bring them back, each one to his inheritance, and each one to his land.
\verse \textit{And then}, if they diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, ‘\textit{as Adonai lives},’ even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will live in the midst of my people.
\verse But if they do not listen, then \textit{I will completely uproot and destroy that nation}.” \textit{declares} Adonai.

\verseWithHeading{The Linen Loincloth} Thus Adonai said to me: “Go and buy for yourself a loincloth of linen and put it on your loins, but you must not \textit{place} it in water.”
\verse So I bought the loincloth according to the word of Adonai and I put \textit{it} on my loins.
\verse Now the word of Adonai came to me a second \textit{time}, \textit{saying},
\verse “Take the loincloth that you bought, that \textit{is} on your loins, and stand up, go \textit{to the} Euphrates and hide it there in the cleft of the rock.”
\verse So I went and hid it by \textit{the} Euphrates just as Adonai had commanded me.
\verse \textit{And then}, \textit{after a long time}, then Adonai said to me, “Stand up, go \textit{to the} Euphrates and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.”
\verse Then I went \textit{to the} Euphrates and I dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it, and look, the loincloth was ruined; it was not good for anything.
\verse \textit{And then} the word of Adonai came to me, \textit{saying},
\verse “Thus says Adonai: ‘So I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
\verse This evil people, who refuse to listen to my words, who go in the stubbornness of their hearts, and have gone after other gods, to serve them, and to bow in worship to them, let them be like this loincloth which is not good for anything.
\verse For as the loincloth clings to \textit{the} loins of a person, so I caused to cling to me all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah,’ \textit{declares} Adonai, ‘to be for me a people, and a name, and a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.’
\verse “Therefore, you shall say to them this word, ‘Thus says Adonai, the God of Israel: “Every jar must be filled with wine.” ’ And they will say to you, ‘Do we not certainly know that every jar should be filled with wine?’

\verse And I will smash them, each one against his brother, and the fathers and the sons together,” \textit{declares} Adonai. “I will not have compassion, and I will not take pity, and I will not show compassion from destroying them.” ’ ”
\verse Listen, and pay attention, 
you must not be haughty, for Adonai has spoken.
\verse Give glory to Adonai your God \textit{before} he brings darkness, 
and \textit{before} your feet stumble on the mountains at twilight. 
And you will hope for light, but he makes it as gloom, 
he makes \textit{it} as thick darkness.
\verse But if you will not listen to it, 
my inner self will weep in secret places,

\verse “Judah mourns, and her gates languish, 
they are in mourning on the ground, 
and the cry of lament of Jerusalem goes up.
\verse And their nobles send their servants for water. 
They come to \textit{the} pits, they find no water. 
They return \textit{with} their vessels \textit{empty}. 
They are ashamed, and they are confounded, 
and they cover their heads.
\verse Because of the ground, \textit{which} is cracked

\verse And wild asses stand on \textit{the} barren heights,

\verse Although our iniquities testify against us, \textit{O} Adonai, 
act for the sake of your name. 
Yes, our apostasies are many; 
we have sinned against you.
\verse \textit{You are} the hope of Israel, 
its savior in time of distress. 
Why should you be like an alien in the land, 
or like a traveler who spreads out \textit{his tent}  to spend the night?
\verse Why should you be like a confused man, 
like a warrior \textit{who} is not able to help? 
Yet you \textit{are} in our midst, \textit{O} Adonai,

You must not leave us!
\verse Thus says Adonai concerning this people:
\verseWithHeading{Lying Prophets} So Adonai said to me, “You must not pray for this people, for \textit{their} happiness.
\verse Although they fast, I \textit{am} not listening to their cry of entreaty. And although they present burnt offering and grain offering, I \textit{am} not favorable to them. But by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague, I \textit{am} about to destroy them.”
\verse Then I said, “Ah, Lord Adonai, look, the prophets \textit{are} saying to them, ‘You will not see \textit{the} sword, and famine will not be yours, but reliable peace I will give to you in this place.’ ”
\verse And Adonai said to me, “The prophets \textit{are} prophesying lies in my name. I have not sent them, and I have not commanded them, and I have not spoken to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, and a divination, worthless, and the deceitfulness of their \textit{minds}.”
\verse \textit{Therefore} thus says Adonai concerning the prophets who prophecy in my name though I have not sent them, yet they \textit{are} saying, “Sword and famine will not be in this land.” “By the sword and by the famine those prophets will perish.
\verse And the people \textit{to} whom they \textit{are} prophesying will be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem \textit{because of} the famine and the sword. And there will be no \textit{one who} buries them, their wives, or their sons, or their daughters. And I will pour out on them their wickedness.

\verseWithHeading{The Valley of the Slaughter} Thus said Adonai, “Go and buy a potter’s earthenware jar, and \textit{take} some of the elders of the people, and some of the leaders of the priests,
\verse and go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom, which \textit{is at} the entrance of the Gate of the Potsherd, and proclaim there the words that I speak to you.
\verse And you shall say, ‘Hear the word of Adonai, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says Adonai of hosts, the God of Israel: “Look, I \textit{am} about to bring disaster upon this place so that \textit{everyone who hears it}, his ears will ring.
\verse Because they have forsaken me, and they have defaced this place, and they have made smoke offerings in it to other gods whom they have not known, they, nor their ancestors, nor the kings of Judah, and they have filled up this place \textit{with the} blood of \textit{the} innocent,
\verse and they have built the high places of Baal, to burn their children in the fire, burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, and I ordered not, and it did not come to my \textit{mind}.
\verse “\textit{Therefore} look, days \textit{are} about to come,” \textit{declares} Adonai, “when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, \textit{but} the Valley of the Slaughter.
\verse And I will lay waste the plans of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will bring them to ruin by the sword \textit{before} their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life, and I will give their dead bodies as food to the birds of heaven and to the animals of the earth.
\verse And I will make this city a horror, and \textit{an object of} hissing, everyone \textit{who} passes by it will be appalled, and will hiss because of all its wounds.
\verse And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons, and the flesh of their daughters, and each one will eat the flesh of his neighbor in \textit{the} siege and in \textit{the} distress which their enemies and those who seek their life inflict on them.” ’
\verse “Then you shall break the jar before the eyes of the men who go with you.
\verse And you shall say to them, ‘Thus says Adonai of hosts: “So I will break this people and this city as one breaks the vessel of the potter, \textit{so} that it is not able to be repaired again. And in Topheth they will bury \textit{until there is no room to bury}.
\verse Thus will I do to this place,” \textit{declares} Adonai, “and to its inhabitants, to make this city like Topheth.
\verse And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be unclean like the place of Topheth, all the houses where they made smoke offerings upon their roofs to all the host of heaven, and \textit{where} they poured out libations to other gods.” ’ ”
\verse Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where Adonai had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the courtyard of the house of Adonai and said to all the people,
\verse “Thus says Adonai of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Look, I \textit{am} about to bring to this city and upon all its towns all the disaster that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their neck to not hear my words.’ ”

\verseWithHeading{A Message for Pashhur} Now Pashhur, the son of Immer, the priest \textit{who was} officer in charge in the temple of Adonai, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
\verse Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that \textit{were} in the upper Gate of Benjamin, which \textit{was} by the temple of Adonai.
\verse \textit{And then} on the next day, when Pashhur brought Jeremiah out from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “Adonai will not call your name Pashhur, \textit{but} Terror From All Around.
\verse For thus says Adonai, ‘Look, I \textit{am} making you a terror to yourself and to all your friends, and they will fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes \textit{will be} seeing \textit{it}. And all Judah I will give into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will deport them \textit{to} Babylon, and he will strike them with the sword.
\verse And I will give all the wealth of this city, and all its acquisitions, and all its precious items, and all of the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give into the hand of their enemies, and they will plunder them, and they will seize them, and they will bring them \textit{to} Babylon.
\verse And you, Pashhur, and all \textit{those who} live \textit{in} your house will go into captivity, and you will go \textit{to} Babylon, and there you will die, and there you will be buried, you, and all your friends to whom you have prophesied \textit{falsely}.’ ”
\verseWithHeading{Jeremiah’s Lament} You have persuaded me, \textit{O} Adonai, and I was persuaded. 
You have overpowered me, and you have prevailed. 
I have become a laughingstock all day \textit{long}. 
\textit{Everyone} \textit{is} mocking me.
\verse For \textit{as often as} I speak, 
I must cry out violence and destruction. 
I must shout, for the word of Adonai has become for me 
a disgrace and derision all day \textit{long}.
\verse But \textit{if} I say, “I will not mention him 
and I will no longer speak in his name,” 
then it becomes in my heart like a fire burning,

and I struggle to contain \textit{it}, 
and I am not able.
\verse For I hear the rumor of many, 
“Terror \textit{is} from all around, denounce \textit{him}, 
yes, let us denounce him!” 
\textit{All my close friends} \textit{are} watchers of my stumbling, 
\textit{saying}, “perhaps he can be persuaded, 
and we can prevail over him, 
and we can take our revenge on him.”
\verse But Adonai \textit{is} with me like a powerful warrior. 
\textit{Therefore} my persecutors will stumble and will not prevail. 
They will be very ashamed, for they will not achieve success. 
\textit{Their} \textit{everlasting insult} will not be forgotten.
\verse Yet, \textit{O} Adonai of hosts, who tests \textit{the} righteous, 
who sees \textit{the} \textit{heart} and \textit{the} \textit{mind}, 
let me see your retribution upon them, 
for to you I have revealed my legal case.

\verse Cursed be the man who brought the news \textit{to} my father, 
\textit{saying}, “A child is born to you, a son!” 
and he made him very glad.
\verse And let that man be like the cities 
that Adonai demolished without regret, 
and let him hear a cry for help in the morning, 
and an alarm at the time of noon.
\verse Because he did not kill me in \textit{the} womb, 
so that my mother would have been for me my grave, 
and \textit{her} womb \textit{would be} pregnant forever.

\verse “Please inquire \textit{of} Adonai on behalf of us, for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon \textit{is} fighting against us. Perhaps Adonai will do with us according to all his miraculous acts, so that he may go up from against us.”
\verse Then Jeremiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to Zedekiah:
\verse ‘Thus says Adonai, the God of Israel: “Look, I \textit{am} about to turn back the weapons of war that \textit{are} in your hands, \textit{with} which you \textit{are} fighting against them, the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are laying siege to you from outside the wall, and I will gather them into the center of this city.

\verse And I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both humankind and animal; by a great plague they will die.
\verse And \textit{afterward},” \textit{declares} Adonai, “I will give Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and those who remain in this city from the plague, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their lives, and he will strike them with \textit{the} \textit{edge} of \textit{the} sword.

\verse Thus says Adonai: “Go down \textit{to} the house of the king of Judah and you must speak this word there.
\verse And you must say, ‘Hear the word of Adonai, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people who enter through these gates.
\verse Thus says Adonai, “Act \textit{with} justice and righteousness, and deliver \textit{the} one who has been seized from the hand of \textit{the} oppressor. And you must not oppress \textit{the} immigrant, \textit{the} orphan, and \textit{the} widow. And you must not shed innocent blood in this place.
\verse And if you indeed obey this word, then kings who sit for David on his throne will enter through the gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.
\verse But if you do not obey these words, I swear by myself,” \textit{declares} Adonai, “that this house will become a site of ruins.” ’ ”
\verse For thus says Adonai concerning the house of the king of Judah,
\verse “You \textit{are like} Gilead to me, 
\textit{like} the head of the Lebanon. 
\textit{Surely} I will make you a desert, 
\textit{like} cities \textit{that} are not inhabited.
\verse And many nations will pass by this city and they will say each one to his neighbor, ‘\textit{Why} has Adonai done in this manner to this great city?’
\verse Then they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of Adonai their God, and bowed down in worship to other gods, and served them.’ ”
\verse You must not weep for \textit{the} dead person, 
and you must not show sympathy for him. 
Weep bitterly for the one who goes away, 
for he will not return, or see the land of his birth again.
\verse For thus says Adonai concerning Shallum, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, who reigned as king in place of Josiah his father, who went out from this place: “He will not return here again.
\verse But in \textit{the} place where they have deported him, there he will die, and he will not see this land again.
\verse Woe \textit{to the one who} builds his house without righteousness, 
and his upper rooms without justice. 
His fellow countryman, he works for nothing, 
and he does not give to him his wages.
\verse Who says ‘I will build for myself 
a spacious house with large upper rooms,’ 
and he cuts windows for it, 
and \textit{it is} paneled with cedar, 
and he paints \textit{it} with vermilion.
\verse Do you reign as king because you \textit{are} competing in cedar? 
Did not your father eat and drink, 
and he did justice and righteousness, 
then it was well with him?
\verse He judged \textit{the} legal cause of \textit{the} needy and \textit{the} poor, 
\textit{and} then it was well. 
\textit{Is that not what it means to know me}?” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “But there is nothing \textit{in} your eyes and your heart 
\textit{except} your unlawful gain, 
and on shedding the blood of the innocent, 
and on committing oppression and extortion.”
\verse \textit{Therefore} thus says Adonai concerning Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah:
\verse “They will not lament for him, 
‘Alas, my brother,’ or ‘Alas, sister.’ 
They will not lament for him, 
‘Alas, lord,’ or ‘alas, his majesty.’
\verse He will be buried \textit{with} the burial of a donkey. 
\textit{He will be} dragged away and thrown \textit{outside} the gates of Jerusalem.
\verse Go up \textit{to} Lebanon and cry out, 
and in Bashan lift up your voice, 
and cry out from Abarim,

for you have not obeyed my voice.
\verse All your shepherds will shepherd \textit{the} wind, 
and your lovers will go into captivity. 
Yes, then you will be ashamed and humiliated 
because of all your wickedness.
\verse “As I live,” \textit{declares} Adonai, “surely if Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, were \textit{the} seal on my right hand, surely from there I would wrench you off.
\verse And I would give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of those from whom you \textit{are} frightened by their presence, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.

for I will bring disaster on them \textit{in} the year of their punishment,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “Now in the prophets of Samaria I saw a disgusting thing. 
They prophesied by Baal and they caused my people Israel to err.

‘Peace it will be to you,’

‘Calamity will not come upon you.’

\verseWithHeading{Jeremiah Escapes Death} At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, this word came from Adonai, \textit{saying},
\verse “Thus says Adonai: ‘Stand in the courtyard of the house of Adonai, and you must speak to all the cities of Judah that come to bow in worship \textit{in} the house of Adonai all the words that I command you to speak to them. You must not omit a word.
\verse Perhaps they will listen and turn back each from his evil way, and I will relent of the disaster that I \textit{am} planning to do to them because of their evil deeds.
\verse And you shall say to them, “Thus says Adonai: ‘If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set \textit{before you},
\verse to listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I have sent to you, \textit{over and over again}, though you have not listened,
\verse then I will make this house like Shiloh, and this city I will make a curse for all the nations of the earth.’ ” ’ ”
\verse And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the temple of Adonai.
\verse \textit{And then} as Jeremiah finished speaking all that Adonai had commanded \textit{him} to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, \textit{saying}, “You will die!
\verse Why have you prophesied in the name of Adonai, \textit{saying}, ‘This house will be like Shiloh, and this city will be in ruins, \textit{without} inhabitant’?” And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the temple of Adonai.
\verse When the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the house of the king \textit{to} the temple of Adonai, and they sat in the entrance of the New Gate of Adonai’s \textit{temple}.
\verse Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the people, \textit{saying}, “\textit{This man deserves the death sentence}, because he has prophesied against this city as that \textit{which} you have heard with your ears.”
\verse Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and to all the people, \textit{saying}, “Adonai sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.
\verse Now \textit{therefore} amend your ways and your deeds, and obey the voice of Adonai your God, and Adonai will relent of the disaster that he has spoken over you.
\verse But \textit{as for} me, look, I \textit{am} in your hand, do to me what \textit{is} good and right in your eyes.
\verse Only you must certainly know that if you put me to death, you will bring on yourselves innocent blood, and on this city and on its inhabitants, for \textit{truly} Adonai sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.”
\verse Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, “\textit{This man does not deserve} a sentence of death, for in the name of Adonai our God, he has spoken to us.”
\verse Then men from the elders of the land arose and said to all the assembly of the people, \textit{saying},
\verse “Micah the Morashtite was prophesying in the days of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and he said to all the people of Judah, \textit{saying}:
\verse \textit{Did} Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and all Judah actually put him to death? \textit{Was he} not in fear of Adonai? And he entreated the face of Adonai, and Adonai relented of the disaster that he had spoken against them. But we \textit{are} about to do great disaster to ourselves.”
\verse Indeed, there also was a man prophesying in the name of Adonai, Uriah, the son of Shemaiah, from Kiriath-Jearim, and he prophesied against this city and against this land like all the words of Jeremiah.
\verse And when King Jehoiakim, and all his warriors, and all the officials heard his words, then the king sought to put him to death. But Uriah heard, and he was afraid, and he fled and went \textit{to} Egypt.
\verse Then King Jehoiakim sent men \textit{to} Egypt. Elnathan, the son of Achbor, and men with him \textit{went} to Egypt.
\verse And they brought out Uriah from Egypt and they brought him to King Jehoiakim, and he struck him down with the sword, and he threw his dead body into the burial sites of the sons of the people.
\verse However, the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not given into the hand of the people to put him to death.

\verse And you must command them for their masters, \textit{saying}, ‘Thus says Adonai of hosts, the God of Israel, this you shall say to your masters:
\verse “I have made the earth with humankind and animals that \textit{are} on the face of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and I give it to whomever is right in my eyes.
\verse And now I myself have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and also the animals of the field I have given to him to serve him.

\verse Why should you die—you and your people—by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague, as Adonai has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
\verse And you must not listen to the words of the prophets who are speaking to you, \textit{saying}, ‘You must not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they \textit{are} prophesying a lie to you.

and every person \textit{who} languishes I will replenish.”
\verseWithHeading{The New Covenant} “Look, \textit{the} days \textit{are} coming,” \textit{declares} Adonai, “and I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah \textit{with the} seed of humankind, and \textit{with the} seed of animals.
\verse \textit{And then} as I have watched over them to pull up, and to tear down, and to annihilate, and to destroy, and to do evil, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “In those days they will say no longer, ‘\textit{Parents} have eaten unripe fruit, and \textit{the} teeth of \textit{the} children \textit{are set on edge}.’
\verse \textit{But} each will die because of his iniquity, \textit{everyone} who eats the unripe fruit, their teeth will \textit{be set on edge}.
\verse Look, \textit{the} days \textit{are} coming,” \textit{declares} Adonai, “and I will \textit{make} a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,
\verse not like the covenant that I \textit{made} with their ancestors on the day of my grasping \textit{them} by their hand, bringing them out from the land of Egypt, my covenant that they themselves broke, though I myself was a master over them,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “But this \textit{is} the covenant that I will \textit{make} with the house of Israel after those days,” \textit{declares} Adonai: “I will put my law in their inward parts and on their hearts I will write it, and I will be to them God, and they themselves will be to me people.
\verse And they will no longer teach each one his neighbor, or each one his brother, \textit{saying}, ‘Know Adonai,’ for all of them will know me, from their \textit{smallest} and up to their \textit{greatest},” \textit{declares} Adonai, “for I will forgive their iniquity and their sin I will no longer remember.”
\verse Thus says Adonai, who gives \textit{the} sun for light by day, the regulations of \textit{the} moon and \textit{the} stars for light \textit{by} night, who stirs up the sea and its waves roar—Adonai of hosts \textit{is} his name.
\verse “If these rules would cease from \textit{before me},” \textit{declares} Adonai, “also the offspring of Israel would cease from being a nation \textit{before me} \textit{forever}.”
\verse Thus says Adonai, “If \textit{the} heavens above can be measured, and \textit{the} foundations of \textit{the} earth below can be explored, also I will reject all the offspring of Israel because of all that they have done,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “Look, days \textit{are} coming,” \textit{declares} Adonai, “and the city will be rebuilt for Adonai, from the Tower of Hananel \textit{to} the Corner Gate.
\verse And \textit{the measuring line} will still go out immediately in front \textit{of} it to the hill of Gareb, and it will turn \textit{to} Goah.
\verse And the whole of the valley \textit{of} the corpses, and the ashes, and all the cultivated fields up to the wadi of Kidron, up to the corner of the Gate of the Horses \textit{toward the} east \textit{will be} holy to Adonai. It will not be uprooted, and it will not be overthrown again \textit{forever}.”

\verseWithHeading{Jeremiah Buys a Field} The word that came to Jeremiah from Adonai in the tenth year of Zedekiah the king of Judah, that \textit{was} the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
\verse Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon \textit{was} laying siege to Jerusalem and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard that \textit{was in} the palace of the king of Judah,
\verse where Zedekiah, the king of Judah, had confined him, \textit{saying}, “Why \textit{are} you prophesying, \textit{saying}, ‘Thus says Adonai, “Look, I \textit{am} going to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it,
\verse and Zedekiah, the king of Judah, will not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but surely he will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and \textit{he will speak face to face with him} and \textit{he will see him eye to eye},
\verse and \textit{to} Babylon he will bring Zedekiah, and there he will be until my attending to him,” \textit{declares} Adonai. “If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not be successful” ’?”
\verse And Jeremiah said, “The word of Adonai came to me, \textit{saying},
\verse ‘Look, Hanamel, the son of Shallum, your uncle, \textit{is} going to come to you, \textit{saying}, “Buy for yourself my field that \textit{is} at Anathoth, for \textit{you have} the right of redemption to buy \textit{it}.” ’
\verse Then Hanamel, the son of my uncle, came to me, to the courtyard of the guard \textit{according to} the word of Adonai, and he said to me, ‘Please buy my field that \textit{is} at Anathoth, that \textit{is} in the land of Benjamin, for to you \textit{is} the claim of possession, and to you the redemption; buy \textit{it} for yourself.’ Then I knew that this \textit{was} the word of Adonai.
\verse And I bought the field from Hanamel, the son of my uncle, that \textit{was} at Anathoth. And I weighed out to him the money, seventeen silver shekels.
\verse And I signed on the letter and sealed \textit{it}, and I called witnesses as witness, and I weighed out the money on a set of scales.
\verse Then I took the deed of the purchase, the sealed \textit{copy containing} the commandments and the rules, together with the \textit{one} that was open.
\verse And I gave the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, \textit{in the presence of} Hanamel, \textit{the son of} my uncle, and \textit{in the presence of} the witnesses who signed the deed of the purchase, \textit{in the presence of} the Judeans who were sitting in the courtyard of the guard.
\verse And I commanded Baruch \textit{in their presence}, \textit{saying},
\verse ‘Thus says Adonai of hosts, the God of Israel, “Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase, the sealed one, and this opened deed, and you must put them in an \textit{earthenware jar} so that they may be kept preserved many days.”
\verse For thus says Adonai of hosts, the God of Israel: “Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.” ’
\verse And I prayed to Adonai—after giving my deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah—\textit{saying},
\verse ‘Ah Lord Adonai! Look, you made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm. \textit{Nothing} is too difficult for you,
\verse showing loyal love to the thousands, and repaying the guilt of \textit{parents} into the laps of their children after them. Powerful, great, mighty, his name \textit{is} Adonai of hosts,
\verse great in counsel and great \textit{in} deed, whose eyes \textit{are} opened to all the ways of the children of humankind, to give to each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds,
\verse who accomplished signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, up to this day, and in Israel, and among humankind, and you have made for yourself a name, as \textit{it is} this day.
\verse And you brought out your people Israel from the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an arm stretched out, and with great terror.
\verse And you gave to them this land, which you swore to their ancestors to give to them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\verse And they entered and took possession of it, but they did not listen to your voice, and they did not follow your law. They did nothing of all that you commanded to them to do, and you caused to happen \textit{to} them all this disaster.
\verse Look, the siege ramps have come up \textit{to} the city to capture it, and the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it, because of the sword, the famine, and the plague, and what you spoke happened, and look, you \textit{are} seeing \textit{it}.
\verse Yet you have said to me, Lord Adonai, “Buy for yourself the field with the money, and call witnesses as witness,” though the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ ”
\verse And the word of Adonai came to Jeremiah, \textit{saying},
\verse “Look, I \textit{am} Adonai, \textit{the} God of all flesh; is \textit{anything} too difficult for me?”
\verse \textit{Therefore} thus says Adonai: “Look, I \textit{am} going to give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.
\verse And the Chaldeans, who are fighting against this city, will come and set this city on fire, and they will burn it, and the houses where they have made smoke offerings on their roofs to Baal, and \textit{where} they have devoted libations to other gods, in order to provoke me to anger.
\verse For the people of Israel and the people of Judah were doing only evil in my eyes from their youth, for the people of Israel \textit{were} only provoking me to anger by the work of their hands,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “For this city has been for me \textit{a cause} of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even until this day, \textit{so I will} remove it from my \textit{sight},
\verse because of all the evil of the people of Israel and the people of Judah that they did to provoke me to anger—they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\verse And they have turned to me \textit{their} backs and not \textit{their} faces, though \textit{I have taught them over and over again}, but they \textit{were} not listening to accept discipline.
\verse And they set up their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it.
\verse And they built the high places of Baal that \textit{are} in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to present as offerings their sons and their daughters to Molech, which I had not commanded them, and it had not come to my \textit{mind} to do this detestable thing in order to cause Judah to sin.”
\verse “So now \textit{therefore}, thus says Adonai, the God of Israel, concerning this city, \textit{of} which you \textit{are} saying, ‘It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague’:
\verse Look, I \textit{am} going to gather them from all the lands \textit{to} which I driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath, and I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell \textit{in safety}.
\verse And they will be for me a people, and I will be for them God.
\verse And I will give to them one heart and one way, to revere me \textit{forever}, for good to them, and to their children after them.
\verse And I will \textit{make} with them \textit{an everlasting covenant} that I will not turn away from them, my doing good \textit{to} them, and my reverence I will put in their hearts so that \textit{they will} not turn aside from me.
\verse And I will rejoice over them to do good \textit{to} them, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness with all my heart, and with all my inner self.”
\verse “For thus says Adonai, ‘Just as I have brought to this people all this great disaster, so I \textit{will} bring upon them all the good that I promise to them.
\verse And the fields will be bought in this land \textit{of} which you \textit{are} saying, “It \textit{is} a desolation, \textit{without humankind or animals}. It has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.”
\verse They will buy fields with money, and they will sign the deeds, and they will seal \textit{them}, and they will call witnesses as witness in the land of Benjamin, and in the surroundings of Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill country, and in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negev, for I will restore their fortunes,’ \textit{declares} Adonai.”

\verseWithHeading{The Fortunes of Judah and Israel Will Be Restored} And the word of Adonai came to Jeremiah \textit{a} second \textit{time} while he \textit{was} still held back in the courtyard of the guard, \textit{saying},
\verse “Thus says Adonai who made \textit{the earth}, Adonai who formed it to establish it, Adonai \textit{is} his name:
\verse ‘Call to me, and I will answer you, and I will tell you great \textit{things} and inaccessible \textit{things that} you have not known.’
\verse For thus says Adonai, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, that were torn down \textit{to make a defense} against the siege ramps and against the sword:
\verse ‘\textit{They are} coming to fight against the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the corpses of the people whom I will strike in my anger and in my wrath, for whom I have hidden my face from this city because of all their wickedness.
\verse Look, I \textit{am} going to bring healing and health to it, and I will heal them, and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and reliability.
\verse And I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and I will rebuild them as in the beginning.
\verse And I will cleanse them from all their guilt that they sinned against me, and I will forgive all their iniquities that they sinned against me, and that they rebelled against me.
\verse And it will be to me a name of jubilation, a praise, and a glory before all the nations of the earth, who will hear all the good that I \textit{will} do \textit{for} them, and they will fear, and they will tremble because of all the good, and because of all the prosperity that I \textit{will} provide for it.’
\verse “Thus says Adonai: ‘Again will be heard in this place, \textit{of} which you \textit{are} saying, “It \textit{is} a waste, \textit{without} people and \textit{without} animals,” in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, \textit{without} people and \textit{without} inhabitants and \textit{without} animals,

\verse In the towns of the hill country, in the towns of the Shephelah, and in the towns of the Negev, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the surroundings \textit{of} Jerusalem, and in the towns of Judah, flocks will again pass under \textit{the} hands of \textit{the} counter,’ says Adonai.
\verse ‘Look, days \textit{are} coming,’ \textit{declares} Adonai, ‘and I will fulfill the good promise that I promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.

\verse In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell \textit{safely}, and this \textit{is} what they shall call it: “Adonai \textit{is} our righteousness.” ’

\verse “Thus says Adonai: ‘If you could break my covenant \textit{with} the day, and my covenant \textit{with} the night, so that day and night \textit{would} not come at their time,
\verse then my covenant could be broken with David my servant, from \textit{having} a son who could rule on his throne, and with the Levites, the priests, my ministers.
\verse As the host of heaven cannot be counted, and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will make numerous the offspring of David my servant and the Levites \textit{who} minister \textit{to} me.’ ”
\verse And the word of Adonai came to Jeremiah, \textit{saying},
\verse “Have you not seen how these people speak, \textit{saying}, ‘The two clans whom Adonai chose, he has also rejected them’? Thus they spurn my people from being a nation \textit{before them} \textit{any} longer.
\verse Thus says Adonai: ‘If my covenant \textit{with} day and \textit{with} night, \textit{the} regulations of heaven and earth, I had not established,

\verse And you turned back \textit{recently} and you did right in my eyes, to proclaim release each one to his neighbor, and you \textit{made} a covenant \textit{before me} in the house that is called \textit{by} my name.

\verse Then I \textit{set} \textit{before} the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine and cups, and I said to them, “Drink wine.”
\verse But they answered, “We will not drink wine, for Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our ancestor, commanded us, \textit{saying}, ‘You shall not drink wine, you or your children, \textit{forever}.
\verse And you shall not build a house, and you shall not sow seed, and you shall not plant a vineyard, and it shall not be for you, but in tents you shall live all your days, so that you may live many days on the surface of the land where you \textit{are} dwelling as aliens.’

\verse \textit{And then}, as Jehudi read three or four columns, he would cut it up in pieces with the knife of the scribe, and he would throw \textit{it} into the fire that \textit{was} in the fire-pot until the whole of the scroll \textit{was} consumed in the fire that was in the fire-pot.
\verse And the king and any of his servants who heard all these words were not startled, and they did not tear their garments.
\verse And even \textit{when} Elnathan, and Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
\verse And the king commanded Jerahmeel, the son of the king, and Seraiah, the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but Adonai hid them.
\verse And the word of Adonai came to Jeremiah after the king burned the scroll and the words that Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah, \textit{saying},
\verse “\textit{Take again} for yourself another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll which Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, has burned.
\verse And concerning Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, you shall say, ‘Thus says Adonai, “You have burned this scroll, \textit{saying}, ‘Why have you written in it, \textit{saying}, “The king of Babylon will certainly come and he will destroy this land, and he will cause to disappear from it humankind and animals”?’ ”
\verse \textit{Therefore} thus says Adonai concerning Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, “There will not be for him \textit{one who} sits on the throne of David. And his dead body will be thrown out to the heat in the day and to the frost in the night.
\verse And I will punish him, and his offspring, and his servants for their guilt, and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the people of Judah all the disaster with which I have threatened them, but they would not listen.” ’ ”
\verse Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah, the secretary, and he wrote on it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, had burned in the fire, and furthermore was added to them many words like these.

\verseWithHeading{The Babylonians Withdraw to Meet a Threat from Egypt} And king Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had made king, reigned as king in the land of Judah in place of Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim.
\verse But he and his servants and the people of the land did not listen to the words of Adonai that he spoke by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.
\verse And king Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, \textit{saying}, “Please pray for us to Adonai our God.”
\verse Now Jeremiah \textit{was} coming and going out in the midst of the people and they had not put him \textit{in} the house of imprisonment.
\verse And the army of Pharaoh had come out from Egypt, and the Chaldeans, who were laying siege to Jerusalem, heard their report and they withdrew from Jerusalem.
\verse And the word of Adonai came to Jeremiah the prophet, \textit{saying},
\verse “Thus says Adonai, the God of Israel, ‘This is what you shall say to the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire \textit{of} me, “Look, the army of Pharaoh, which set out to help you, \textit{is} going to return to his land Egypt.
\verse And the Chaldeans will return, and they will fight against this city, and they will capture it, and they will burn it with fire.” ’
\verse Thus says Adonai: ‘You must not deceive yourselves, \textit{saying}, “Surely the Chaldeans will go from us,” for they will not go.
\verse For \textit{even} if you struck the whole army of \textit{the} Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and \textit{only} men pierced through remained among them, each one in his tent, they would rise up and they would burn this city with fire.’ ”
\verseWithHeading{Jeremiah is Arrested and Put in Prison} \textit{And then}, at the withdrawing of the army of the Chaldeans from Jerusalem \textit{before} the army of Pharaoh,
\verse Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go \textit{to} the land of Benjamin to receive a portion from there in the midst of the people.
\verse \textit{And when} he \textit{was} at the Gate of Benjamin, there \textit{was} \textit{a sentry on duty} whose name \textit{was} Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, \textit{saying}, “You \textit{are} deserting to the Chaldeans!”
\verse And Jeremiah said, “\textit{That is} a lie! I \textit{am} not deserting to the Chaldeans.” But he would not listen to him. So Irijah seized Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
\verse And the officials were angry at Jeremiah and they struck him. And they put him \textit{in} \textit{prison}, \textit{in} the house of Jonathan the secretary, for they had converted it to the \textit{prison}.
\verse So Jeremiah came to the \textit{dungeon}, even to the vaulted cells, and Jeremiah stayed there many days.
\verse Then King Zedekiah sent and fetched him. And the king questioned him in secrecy in his house, and he said, “Is there a word from Adonai?” And Jeremiah said, “There is.” And he said, “You will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon.”
\verse Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What did I do wrong to you, or to your servants, or to this people, that you have put me in \textit{prison}?
\verse And where \textit{are} your prophets who prophesied to you, \textit{saying}, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land’?
\verse Now then, my lord the king, please let my plea fall \textit{before you}. You must not send me back \textit{to} the house of Jonathan the secretary, so that I will not die there.”
\verse So King Zedekiah commanded, and they handed Jeremiah over in the courtyard of the guard, and they gave to him a round loaf of bread from the street of the bakers \textit{every day} until the finishing of all the bread from the city. And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard.

\verseWithHeading{Jeremiah is Thrown into the Pit of Malchiah} Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah \textit{was} saying to all the people, \textit{saying},
\verse “Thus says Adonai, ‘The \textit{one who} stays in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague. But the \textit{one who} goes out to the Chaldeans will live. And his life will be for him as booty, and he will live.’
\verse Thus says Adonai, ‘Surely this city will be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.’ ”
\verse Then the officials said to the king, “Please, this man must be killed, \textit{because} he \textit{is} making slack the hands of \textit{the soldiers} who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking to them words like these, for this man \textit{is} not seeking for welfare to this people, \textit{but only} for harm.”
\verse And Zedekiah the king said, “Look, he \textit{is} in your hand, for the king is not able \textit{to do} a thing against you.”
\verse So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the pit \textit{of} Malchiah, the son of the king, which \textit{was} in the courtyard of the guard. And they let Jeremiah down by ropes. Now in the pit there was no water, \textit{but only} mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.
\verse When Ebed-melech the Cushite, \textit{a eunuch} who \textit{was} in the house of the king, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the pit—now the king \textit{was} sitting at the Gate of Benjamin—
\verse Ebed-melech went out from the house of the king and spoke to the king, \textit{saying},
\verse “My lord the king, these men have done evil \textit{in} all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, \textit{in} that they have thrown \textit{him} into the pit, and he will die \textit{there} \textit{because of} starvation, for there is no longer any bread in the city.”
\verse Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, \textit{saying}, “Take \textit{with you} these thirty men and pull Jeremiah the prophet up from the pit \textit{before} he dies.”
\verse So Ebed-melech took the men \textit{with him} and went \textit{to} the palace of the king, to \textit{a place} beneath the storehouse, and he took from there \textit{rags} and \textit{worn-out clothes}. And he let them down into the pit by ropes to Jeremiah.
\verse Then Ebed-melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Please put \textit{the rags} and \textit{worn-out clothes} under the joints of your arms under the ropes,” and Jeremiah did so.
\verse And they pulled Jeremiah by the ropes and brought him up from the pit. And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard.
\verse And Zedekiah the king sent and made someone bring Jeremiah the prophet to him, to \textit{the} third entrance that \textit{was} at the \textit{temple} of Adonai. And the king said to Jeremiah, “I \textit{am} asking you \textit{something}, you must not hide \textit{anything} from me.”
\verse And Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not surely kill me? \textit{Besides}, if I advise you, you will not listen to me.
\verse So Zedekiah the king swore to Jeremiah in secret, \textit{saying}, “\textit{As Adonai lives}, who has made for us this life, I will not kill you and I will not give you into the hand of these men who are seeking your life.”
\verse Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says Adonai, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘If only you will go surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then \textit{you} will live, and this city will not be burned with fire, and you will live, you and your house.
\verse But if you \textit{do} not go surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you will not escape from their hand.’ ”
\verse And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I \textit{am} afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest they give me into their hand and they abuse me.”
\verse And Jeremiah said, “They will not give \textit{you over}. Please obey the voice of Adonai with regard to what I \textit{am} saying to you, and it will go well with you, and \textit{you} will live.
\verse But if you \textit{are} refusing to surrender, this \textit{is} the thing that Adonai has shown me.
\verse Now look, all the women who remain in the house of the king of Judah \textit{are} being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon. And look, \textit{they are} saying,
\verse And all your wives and your children \textit{will be} led out to the Chaldeans, and you will not escape from their hand, but by the hand of the king of Babylon you will be seized, and this city will burn with fire.”
\verse And Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “No man must know about these words so that you will not die.
\verse And if the officials hear that I have spoken with you, and they come to you and say to you, ‘Please tell us what you said to the king. You must not conceal \textit{it} from us so that we will not kill you. And what did the king say to you?’
\verse Then you shall say to them, ‘I \textit{was} presenting my plea \textit{before} the king, to not cause me to return \textit{to} the house of Jonathan to die there.’ ”

\verse \textit{And then} \textit{when} Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all \textit{the soldiers} \textit{with him}, they fled and went out \textit{at} night from the city \textit{by} the way of the garden of the king through \textit{the} gate between the walls. And they went out toward the Jordan Valley.
\verse But the army of \textit{the} Chaldeans pursued after them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And they took him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon \textit{at} Riblah in the land of Hamath. And he pronounced \textit{sentence} on him.
\verse And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also slaughtered all the nobles of Judah.
\verse Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah and tied him up with bronze fetters to bring him \textit{to} Babylon.
\verse And the Chaldeans burned the palace of the king and the houses of the people with fire and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
\verse Then the rest of the people who were left in the city, and those deserting who had deserted to him, and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan, \textit{the} captain of \textit{the} guard, deported \textit{to} Babylon.
\verse And some of the poor people, \textit{who had nothing}, Nebuzaradan, \textit{the} captain of \textit{the} guard, left in the land of Judah. And he gave them vineyards and fields on that day.

\verse And \textit{the} captain of \textit{the} guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “Adonai your God threatened this disaster to this place,
\verse and \textit{now} he has brought \textit{it about}, and Adonai has done \textit{just as} he threatened. Because you sinned against Adonai and did not listen to his voice, so this thing \textit{has} happened to you.

\verse Now the pit \textit{into} which Ishmael threw all the corpses of the men whom he had killed \textit{along with} Gedaliah \textit{was the same one} that King Asa had made because of Baasha the king of Israel, \textit{who was} against him.

\verseWithHeading{A Message of Rebuke for the Rebellious Remnant} The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Judeans who were living in the land of Egypt, who were living at Migdol, and Tahpanhes, and Memphis, and in the land of Pathros, \textit{saying},
\verse “Thus says Adonai of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘You yourselves have seen all the disaster that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the towns of Judah. And look, they \textit{are} a site of ruins this day, and there is not in them an inhabitant,
\verse \textit{because of} their wickedness that they committed to provoke me to anger by going to make smoke offerings, serving other gods whom they had not known, \textit{neither} they, you, or your ancestors.
\verse And I sent to you all my servants the prophets, \textit{sending over and over again}, \textit{saying}, “Please, you must not do this detestable thing that I hate.”
\verse But they did not listen and they did not incline their ears to turn back from their wickedness, to not make smoke offerings to other gods.
\verse So my wrath and my anger were poured out and burned in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they became as a site of ruins, as a desolation, as \textit{they are} this day.’
\verse So then, thus says Adonai, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Why \textit{are} you doing great harm to \textit{yourselves}, to cut off for yourselves man and woman, child and suckling, from the midst of Judah, to not leave over for yourselves a remnant,
\verse provoking me to anger with the works of your hands, to make smoke offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you \textit{have} come to dwell as aliens, so as to cut off yourselves, and so that you are becoming as a curse, and as a disgrace among all the nations of the earth?
\verse Have you forgotten the wicked things of your ancestors, and the wicked things of the kings of Judah, and the wicked things of their wives, and your wicked things, and the wicked things of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\verse They have not shown contrition up to this day, and they have not shown reverence, and they have not walked in my law and in my statutes that I set \textit{before you} and \textit{before} your ancestors.’
\verse \textit{Therefore} thus says Adonai of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Look, \textit{I am determined to bring disaster on you}, even to exterminate all Judah.
\verse And I will take \textit{away} the remnant of Judah \textit{who are determined} to come \textit{to} the land of Egypt to dwell as aliens there, and everyone will perish. They will fall in the land of Egypt by the sword; they will perish by the famine, from \textit{the} smallest to \textit{the} greatest. By the sword and by the famine they will die and become as a curse, as a horror, and as a curse, and as a disgrace.
\verse So I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt just as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague.
\verse And there will not be a survivor or an escapee of the remnant of Judah, those who have come to dwell as an alien there in the land of Egypt, to return \textit{to} the land of Judah where they \textit{are} \textit{longing} to return to dwell there, for they will not turn back, \textit{but only} \textit{some} survivors.’ ”
\verse Then all the men who knew that their wives \textit{were} making smoke offerings to other gods, and all the women who stood \textit{by}, a great assembly, and all the people who lived in the land of Egypt in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, \textit{saying},
\verse “\textit{Concerning} the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Adonai, we \textit{are} not going to listen to you!
\verse But certainly we will do \textit{everything} that went out from our mouths, to make smoke offerings to the queen of heaven and to pour out to her libations just as we did, we, and our ancestors, our kings, and our officials, in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, \textit{for} then \textit{we had enough to eat}, and we were well-off, and we did not see disaster.
\verse But \textit{since} we stopped making smoke offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything, and by the sword and by the famine we have perished.
\verse And indeed, \textit{when} we \textit{were} making smoke offerings to the queen of heaven and \textit{pouring out} to her libations, \textit{was it not} \textit{with the consent of} our husbands \textit{that} we made for her sacrificial cakes \textit{marked with her image}, and we poured out to her libations?”
\verse Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and to the women, and to all the people who answered him a word, \textit{saying},
\verse “The offering that you made, smoke offerings in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you, and your ancestors, your kings, and your officials, and the people of the land, \textit{did} not Adonai remember them, and \textit{did} it \textit{not} come to his \textit{mind}?
\verse And Adonai was no longer able to bear \textit{it}, \textit{because of} the evil of your deeds, \textit{because of} the detestable things that you committed. Thus your land became as a site of ruins, and as a horror, and as a curse, \textit{without} inhabitants, as \textit{it is} this day.
\verse \textit{Because of} \textit{the fact} that you made smoke offerings, and that you sinned against Adonai, and you did not listen to the voice of Adonai, and you have not walked in his law, and in his statute, and in his legal provisions, \textit{therefore} this disaster has happened to you, as \textit{it is} this day.”
\verse Then Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, “Hear the word of Adonai, all Judah who \textit{are} in the land of Egypt.
\verse Thus says Adonai of hosts, the God of Israel, \textit{saying}, ‘You and your wives have promised with your mouths and with your hands you have fulfilled, \textit{saying}, “We certainly will carry out our vows that we vowed, to make smoke offerings to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out to her libations.” You must certainly keep your vows and you must certainly carry out your vows.’
\verse \textit{Therefore} hear the word of Adonai, all Judah, those who live in the land of Egypt: ‘Look, I hereby swear by my great name,’ says Adonai, ‘surely my name will no longer be called in the mouth of any man of Judah, saying, “\textit{as the Lord Adonai lives},” in all the land of Egypt.
\verse Look, I \textit{am} going to watch over them for harm and not for good, and all people of Judah who \textit{are} in the land of Egypt will perish by the sword and by the famine until their perishing.
\verse And \textit{the} survivors of \textit{the} sword will return from the land of Egypt \textit{to} the land of Judah \textit{few in number}. And all the remnant of Judah who have come to the land of Egypt to dwell as aliens there will know whose word will endure, from me or from them.
\verse And this \textit{will be} to you the sign,’ \textit{declares} Adonai, ‘that I \textit{am} going to punish you in this place, so that you may know that surely my words will endure against you for evil.’
\verse Thus says Adonai: ‘Look, I \textit{am} going to give Pharaoh Hophra, the king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his life, just as I gave Zedekiah the king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, his enemy and the one who sought his life.’ ”

\verse “Prepare small shield and shield, 
and approach for the battle!
\verse Harness the horses and mount the steeds! 
And take your stand with helmets! 
Polish the spears! 
Put on the body armor!
\verse Why do I see them terrified? 
\textit{They are} turning back 
and their warriors are beaten down. 
And they have fled \textit{to} a place of refuge 
and they do not turn \textit{back}. 
Terror \textit{is} from all around,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse The swift cannot flee, 
and the warrior cannot escape. 
They have stumbled and they have fallen, 
by the bank of the Euphrates River.
\verse Who \textit{is} this that rises like the Nile, 
like the rivers whose waters surge?
\verse Egypt rises like the Nile, 
even like the rivers \textit{whose} waters surge. 
And he says, “Let me rise, 
let me cover \textit{the} earth, 
let me destroy cities, 
and the inhabitants in them.”
\verse Go up, O horses, 
and drive madly, O chariots, 
and let the warriors go forth; 
Cush and Put, who wield \textit{the} small shield, 
and Lud, who wield \textit{and} bend \textit{the} bow.
\verse For that day \textit{is} to the Lord Adonai of hosts 
a day of retribution, 
to take revenge on his foes. 
And \textit{the} sword will devour and be satisfied, 
and it will drink its fill of their blood,

\verse Go up \textit{to} Gilead and take balm,

and your cry of lament fills the earth. 
For warrior has stumbled against warrior, 
together they have fallen, the two of them.
\verse The word that Adonai spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon to attack the land of Egypt:
\verse “Declare in Egypt, and proclaim in Migdol, 
and proclaim in Memphis and in Tahpanhes, 
say, ‘Take your stand and be prepared, 
for \textit{the} sword will devour \textit{those} all around you.’
\verse Why are your bulls defeated? 
He did not stand because Adonai thrust him down.
\verse He multiplied \textit{the} ones stumbling. 
Furthermore, each one fell to his neighbor, 
and said, ‘Stand up, and let us return to our people 
and to the land of our birth, 
\textit{because of} the \textit{presence} of the sword of the oppressor.’

For I will make a complete destruction in all the nations where I scattered you,

So \textit{I will chase him away hurriedly} from it. 
And whoever \textit{is} chosen I will appoint over it. 
For who \textit{is} like me, and who can summon me? 
And who \textit{is} this, \textit{the} shepherd who can stand \textit{before me}?”
\verse \textit{Therefore} hear the plan of Adonai that he has planned against Edom,

\textit{Surely} he will cause to be desolated over them 
their grazing place.
\verse The earth will quake from the sound of their falling. 
A cry of distress! Their voice will be heard at \textit{the Red Sea}.

\verse “Declare among the nations and proclaim, 
and lift up a banner. 
Proclaim, you must not conceal \textit{it}. 
Say, ‘Babylon is captured, 
Bel is ashamed, 
Merodach is filled with terror, 
her idols are ashamed, 
her idols are filled with terror.
\verse For a nation will come up against her from \textit{the} north. 
It will make her land as a horror, 
and an inhabitant will not be in her. 
From humans to animals they \textit{all} will wander \textit{off}. 
They will go \textit{away}.
\verse In those days and in that time,’ ” \textit{declares} Adonai, 
“the people of Israel will come, 
they and the people of Judah together. 
\textit{Weeping as they go}, they will go, 
and Adonai their God they will seek.
\verse They will ask \textit{the} way \textit{to} Zion, 
\textit{turning} their faces there. 
They will come and join themselves to Adonai 
\textit{by} \textit{an everlasting covenant} \textit{that} will not be forgotten.
\verse My people have become lost sheep, 
their shepherds have caused them to go astray. 
They led them away \textit{to the} mountains. 
From mountain to hill they have gone, 
they have forgotten their resting place.
\verse All \textit{those who} found them have devoured them. 
And their foes have said, ‘We are not guilty, 
\textit{because} they have sinned against Adonai, the \textit{true pasture}, 
even Adonai, the hope of their ancestors.’
\verse Flee from the midst of Babylon, 
and from the land of \textit{the} Chaldeans. 
Go out and be like he-goats 
\textit{before} \textit{the} flock.
\verse For look, I \textit{am} going to stir up, 
and I \textit{am} going to bring against Babylon 
a contingent of great nations 
from \textit{the} land of \textit{the} north. 
And they will draw up a battle formation against her, 
from there she will be captured. 
Their arrows \textit{are} like a warrior \textit{who has} achieved success, 
he does not return without success.
\verse And Chaldea will be as booty, 
all \textit{those who} plunder her will be satisfied,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “Though you rejoice, though you exult, 
O plunderers of my inheritance, 
though you frisk about like a heifer on the grass, 
and you neigh like the powerful stallions,
\verse your mother will be very ashamed. 
\textit{She who} gave birth \textit{to} you will be humiliated. 
Look, \textit{she will be the} least of \textit{the} nations, 
a desert, dry land, and wilderness.
\verse Because of the anger of Adonai she will not be inhabited, 
but she will be a wasteland, all of her. 
Everyone \textit{who} passes by Babylon will be appalled 
and will hiss because of all her wounds.
\verse Draw up a battle formation at Babylon all around, 
all those who bend \textit{the} bow, shoot at her. 
You must not spare arrows, 
for she has sinned against Adonai.
\verse Raise a war cry against her on all sides. 
\textit{She has surrendered}. 
Her towers have fallen, 
her walls are ruined. 
For this \textit{is} the vengeance of Adonai. 
Take revenge on her. 
As she has done \textit{to others}, 
\textit{so} do to her.
\verse Cut off \textit{the} sower from Babylon, 
and \textit{the} one who uses \textit{the} sickle in \textit{the} time of harvest.

lions drove \textit{them} away. 
\textit{The} first who devoured it \textit{was} the king of Assyria,

\verse \textit{Therefore} thus says Adonai of hosts, the God of Israel,
\verse “Look, I \textit{am} going to punish the king of Babylon and his land 
just as I punished the king of Assyria.
\verse And I will restore Israel to its pasture, 
and it will feed \textit{on} Carmel, and \textit{in} Bashan, 
and on the hills of Ephraim, and \textit{in} Gilead 
its hunger will be satisfied.
\verse In those days and at that time,” \textit{declares} Adonai, 
“the guilt of Israel will be sought, but there \textit{is} none, 
and the sins of Judah, but they will not be found, 
for I will forgive those I left behind.
\verse To the land of Merathaim, 
go up against her,

massacre and destroy them,” \textit{declares} Adonai, 
“and do according to all that I have commanded you.
\verse \textit{The} sound of battle \textit{is} in the land, 
and great destruction.
\verse How the blacksmith’s hammer of all the earth is cut down and broken! 
How Babylon has become as a horror among the nations!
\verse I laid a bird snare for you, and you were caught, \textit{O} Babylon. 
But you yourself \textit{did} not know. 
You were discovered and seized, 
because with Adonai you measured yourself.
\verse Adonai has opened his armory, 
and he has brought out the weapons of his wrath, 
for it \textit{is} a word for my Lord Adonai of hosts 
in the land of \textit{the} Chaldeans.
\verse Come against her from \textit{the} end, 
open her granaries. 
Pile her up like heaps and destroy her. 
Let there be no remnant for her.
\verse Massacre all her bulls, 
let them go down to the slaughtering. 
Woe to them, for \textit{their} day has come, 
the time of their punishment.
\verse \textit{There is the} sound of fugitives and survivors

Encamp all around her, 
there must not be for her an escape. 
Take revenge on her according to her deeds. 
According to all that she has done, \textit{so} do to her. 
For against Adonai she has behaved insolently, 
against the Holy One of Israel.
\verse \textit{Therefore} her young men will fall in her public squares, 
and all \textit{her soldiers} will perish on that day,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “Look, I \textit{am} against you, \textit{O} arrogant \textit{one},” 
\textit{declares} Lord Adonai of hosts, 
“for your day has come, 
\textit{the} time \textit{when} I will punish you.
\verse Thus says Adonai of hosts:
\verse “The people of Israel \textit{are} oppressed, 
and the people of Judah likewise, 
\textit{for} all their captors have seized them, 
they refuse to let them go free.
\verse Their redeemer \textit{is} strong, 
his name \textit{is} Adonai of hosts. 
Surely he will plead their case, 
in order to make peace \textit{for} the earth, 
but to cause unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon.
\verse A sword against \textit{the} Chaldeans,” \textit{declares} Adonai, 
“and against the inhabitants of Babylon, 
and against her officials, 
and against her wise men.
\verse A sword against the oracle priests, 
and they will become foolish. 
A sword against her warriors, 
and they will be filled with terror.
\verse A sword against his horses, 
and against his chariots, 
and against all the foreign troops who \textit{are} in the midst of her, 
so that they may become as women. 
A sword against her treasures, 
so that they may be plundered.
\verse A drought \textit{will come} against her waters, 
and they will dry up, 
for it \textit{is} a land of images, 
and because of the frightful \textit{objects}, they act like madmen.
\verse \textit{Therefore} desert creatures will live \textit{there} with jackals, 
and daughters of ostriches will inhabit her. 
And she will not be inhabited again \textit{forever}, 
and she will not be dwelt in \textit{for all generations}.
\verse As \textit{when} God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah 
and their neighbors,” \textit{declares} Adonai, 
“no one will live there, 
and \textit{the} son of humankind will not dwell as an alien in her.
\verse Look, a people \textit{is} about to come 
from \textit{the} north, 
and a great nation and many kings are woken up 
from \textit{the} remotest part of \textit{the} earth.
\verse They keep hold of bow and short sword. 
They \textit{are} cruel and they have no mercy. 
Their sound \textit{is} like the sea, it roars, 
and upon horses they ride. 
Drawn up for battle as a man for the battle, 
against you, O daughter of Babylon.
\verse The king of Babylon heard their report 
and his hands grew slack. 
Anxiety has seized him, 
fear and pain like the \textit{woman who} gives birth.
\verse Look, like a lion he comes up from the thickets of the Jordan 
against \textit{a pastureland by a constantly flowing stream}, 
so \textit{I will chase them away quickly} from her, 
and I will appoint whoever \textit{is} chosen over her. 
For who \textit{is} like me, and who can summon me, 
and who \textit{is} this shepherd who can stand \textit{before me}?
\verse \textit{Therefore} hear the plan of Adonai 
that he has planned against Babylon, 
and his plans 
that he has planned against the land of \textit{the} Chaldeans.

and they will winnow her, 
and they will lay waste her land,

\verse Let not him who bends the bow shoot his bow, 
and let him not rise high in his body armor. 
And you must not spare her young men;

\verse And they will fall slain in the land of \textit{the} Chaldeans,

though their land is full of guilt 
against the Holy One of Israel.”
\verse Flee from the midst of Babylon and save each one his life. 
You must not perish because of her guilt. 
For this \textit{is the} time of vengeance for Adonai, 
he \textit{will} repay her what is deserved.
\verse Babylon \textit{was} a cup of gold in the hand of Adonai, 
making drunk all the earth. 
\textit{The} nations drank of her wine. 
\textit{Therefore} \textit{the} nations acted like madmen.
\verse Suddenly Babylon has fallen and she is shattered. 
Wail over her! 
Take balm for her wounds,

\verse We tried to heal Babylon, and she was not healed. 
Forsake her and let us go each one to his country,

Come and let us make known in Zion the work of Adonai our God.

\verse “Look, I \textit{am} going to contend your case,

and though she fortifies the high place of her strength, 
from me destroyers will come to her,” \textit{declares} Adonai.

and a great collapse from the land of \textit{the} Chaldeans.
\verse For Adonai \textit{is} devastating Babylon, 
and he obliterates \textit{her} loud noise from her. 
Their waves roar like mighty waters, 
the roar of their voices resounds.
\verse For a destroyer \textit{is} coming against her, against Babylon, 
and her warriors are captured. 
Their bows are broken; 
for Adonai \textit{is} a God of recompense, 
certainly he will repay.

\verse And he did evil in the eyes of Adonai like all that Jehoiakim had done.
\verse For because of the \textit{anger} of Adonai this happened in Jerusalem and Judah until his casting them from his \textit{presence}. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
\verse \textit{And then} in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth \textit{day} of the month, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came against Jerusalem, he and all his army. And they laid siege to it, and built siege works against it all around.
\verse So the city came \textit{under siege} until \textit{the} eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
\verse In the fourth month, on \textit{the} ninth \textit{day} of the month, the famine in the city became severe and there was no food for the people of the land.
\verse Then the city was breached, and all \textit{the soldiers} fled and went out from the city \textit{by} night \textit{by the} way of \textit{the} gate between the two walls that \textit{are} at the garden of the king, though \textit{the} Chaldeans \textit{were} all around the city. And they went \textit{in} the direction of the Jordan Valley.
\verse But the army of \textit{the} Chaldeans pursued after the king and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him.
\verse Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon \textit{at} Riblah in the land of Hamath, and \textit{he passed sentence on him}.
\verse And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah.
\verse Then he made blind the eyes of Zedekiah, and they tied him up with bronze fetters, and the king of Babylon brought him \textit{to} Babylon. And he put him in \textit{prison} until the day of his death.

\verse And all the army of \textit{the} Chaldeans who \textit{were} with \textit{the} captain of \textit{the} guard broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around.
\verse And Nebuzaradan \textit{the} captain of \textit{the} guard deported \textit{some} of the poor of the people, and the rest of the people who were left in the city, and the deserters who deserted to the king of Babylon, along with the rest of the craftsmen.
\verse But Nebuzaradan \textit{the} captain of \textit{the} guard left \textit{some} of the poor of the land \textit{to serve} as vinedressers and farmers.
\verse And \textit{the} Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that \textit{were} in the \textit{temple} of Adonai, and the kettle stands and the sea of bronze that \textit{were} in the \textit{temple} of Adonai, and they carried all their bronze \textit{to} Babylon.
\verse And they took with them the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the sprinkling bowls, and the pans, and all the vessels of bronze which \textit{were used in temple} service.
\verse And \textit{the} captain of \textit{the} guard \textit{took} the bowls, and the firepans, and the sprinkling bowls, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the pans, and the libation bowls, \textit{those made of solid gold} and \textit{those made of solid silver}.
\verse The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze oxen that \textit{were} under the kettle stands which King Solomon had made for the \textit{temple} of Adonai—there was not a weight for the bronze of all these vessels!
\verse Now the pillars, \textit{the} height of one pillar \textit{was} eighteen cubits, and a thread of twelve cubits surrounded it, and its thickness \textit{was} four fingers, hollowed out.
\verse And a capital upon it \textit{was} bronze and the height of the one capital \textit{was} five cubits, and latticework and pomegranates \textit{were} on the capital on all sides, all \textit{of} bronze. And like these \textit{was} the second pillar with pomegranates.
\verse And there were ninety-six pomegranates \textit{on the sides}; all the pomegranates on the latticework on all sides \textit{were} a hundred.
\verse Then \textit{the} captain of \textit{the} guard took Seraiah \textit{the chief priest}, and Zephaniah \textit{the second priest}, and three keepers of the threshold.
\verse And from the city he took one high official who was chief officer over \textit{the soldiers}, and seven men of \textit{the king’s advisors} who were found in the city, and the secretary of the commander of the army who levied for military service the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city.
\verse Then Nebuzaradan \textit{the} captain of \textit{the} guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon \textit{at} Riblah.
\verse And the king of Babylon struck them down and killed them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah left from its land.
\verse This \textit{is the number of} the people whom Nebuchadnezzar deported: in \textit{the} seventh year, three thousand twenty-three Judeans;
\verse in \textit{the} eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, eight hundred and thirty-two persons from Jerusalem;
\verse in \textit{the} twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, \textit{the} captain of \textit{the} guard, deported seven hundred and forty-five Judean persons; \textit{there were} four thousand six hundred persons in all.
\verseWithHeading{An Allowance for Jehoiachin} \textit{And then} in \textit{the} thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, in \textit{the} twelfth month, on \textit{the} twenty-fifth \textit{day} of the month, Evil-merodach, the king of Babylon, in the \textit{first} year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, and brought him out from \textit{prison}.
\verse Then he spoke with him kindly and gave his seat above the seats of the kings who \textit{were} with him in Babylon.
\verse So he changed the garments of his imprisonment and he ate food \textit{before him} continually all the days of his life.
\verse And his allowance, a continual allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon \textit{on a daily basis} all the days of his life up to the day of his death.
