\verse{“ ‘However, a man shall not consecrate a firstborn among livestock, which belongs as firstborn to Adonai; whether an ox \textit{or}\lebnote{“whether” or “if”} small livestock, it is for Adonai.}%
\verse{And if it is among the unclean animals, then\lnABV{} he shall ransom it according to your proper value, and he shall add a fifth of its value onto it; and if it is not redeemed, then\lnABV{} it shall be sold according to your proper value.}%
\verse{However, anything devoted\lebnote{Or “permanently set apart”; a different Hebrew word than previously translated “consecrated” in this chapter} that a man has devoted to Adonai \textit{from all that he has},\lebnote{“from all that is for him”} from human or\lnABV{} animal, or\lnABV{} from the field of his property, may not be sold, and it may not be redeemed; anything devoted is \textit{a most holy thing}\lebnote{“a holy thing of holy things”} for Adonai.}%
\verse{Anyone devoted who is devoted from \textit{human beings}\lebnote{“the human”} cannot be ransomed—he shall surely be put to death.}%
