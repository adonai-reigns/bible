\verseWithHeading{Concluding Summary Concerning the Offerings} This \textit{is} the regulation for the burnt offering, for the grain offering and for the sin offering and for the guilt offering and for the consecration \textit{offering} and for the fellowship offerings’ sacrifice,

\begin{biblechapter} % Leviticus 8
\verseWithHeading{Installing the Priests} Then Adonai spoke to Moses, saying,
\verse “Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments and the anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of the unleavened bread,
\verse and summon all of the community to the entrance to the tent of assembly.”
\verse So Moses did \textit{just} as Adonai commanded him, and the community gathered by the entrance to the tent of assembly.
\verse Then Moses said to the community, “This \textit{is} the word that Adonai has commanded to be done.”
\verse So Moses brought Aaron and his sons near, and he washed them with water.
\verse Then he put the tunic on him and tied the sash \textit{around} him; then he clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him; then he tied the ephod’s waistband \textit{around} him and fastened \textit{the ephod} to him with it.
\verse Then he placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and the Thummim into the breastpiece;
\verse and he placed the turban on his head, and on \textit{the front of} the turban he placed the gold rosette, the holy diadem, \textit{just} as Adonai had commanded Moses.
\verse Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that \textit{was} in it, and he consecrated them.
\verse And he spattered \textit{part of} it on the altar seven times—thus he anointed the altar and all of its utensils, and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them.
\verse Then he poured out \textit{part of} the anointing oil on Aaron’s head—thus he anointed him \textit{in order} to consecrate him.
\verse Then Moses brought Aaron’s sons near and clothed them \textit{with} tunics and tied a sash \textit{around} \textit{each one}, and he bound headbands on them, \textit{just} as Adonai had commanded Moses.
\verseWithHeading{The Offerings for Consecration} Then he brought forth the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons placed their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering,
\verse and he slaughtered \textit{it}, and Moses took the blood and put \textit{it} with his finger on the altar’s horns all around and purified the altar; then he poured the blood out on the altar’s base—thus he consecrated it \textit{in order} to make atonement for it.
\verse Then he took all the fat that \textit{was} on the inner parts and the lobe on the liver and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses turned \textit{them} into smoke on the altar,
\verse but he burned the bull and its skin and its meat and its offal in the fire \textit{outside the camp}, \textit{just} as Adonai had commanded Moses.
\verse Then he brought the ram of the burnt offering near, and Aaron and his sons placed their hands on the ram’s head,
\verse and he slaughtered \textit{it}. Then Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar all around.
\verse Then he cut the ram into pieces, and Moses turned into smoke the head and the pieces and the suet,
\verse but he washed the inner parts and the lower leg bones with water, and Moses turned into smoke all of the ram on the altar; it \textit{was} a burnt offering as an appeasing fragrance, an offering made by fire for Adonai, \textit{just} as Adonai had commanded Moses.
\verse Then he brought the second ram near, the ram of the consecration, and Aaron and his sons placed their hands on the ram’s head,
\verse and he slaughtered \textit{it}. Then Moses took \textit{some of} its blood and put \textit{it} on Aaron’s right ear lobe and on his right hand’s thumb and on his right foot’s big toe.
\verse Then he brought Aaron’s sons near, and Moses put \textit{some of} the blood on their right ear lobe and on their right hand’s thumb and on their right foot’s big toe, and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar all around.
\verse Then he took the fat and the fat tail and all of the fat that \textit{was} on the inner parts and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right upper thigh;
\verse and from the basket of the unleavened bread that \textit{was} before Adonai he took one ring-shaped unleavened bread and one ring-shaped bread with oil and one wafer, and he placed \textit{them} on the \textit{fat parts} and on the right upper thigh.
\verse Then he put \textit{all of these} on Aaron’s palms and on his sons’ palms, and he waved them \textit{as} a wave offering \textit{before} Adonai.
\verse Then Moses took them from upon their palms, and he turned \textit{them} into smoke upon the burnt offering on the altar; they \textit{were} a consecration offering as an appeasing fragrance—it \textit{was} an offering made by fire for Adonai.
\verse Then Moses took the breast section, and he waved it \textit{as} a wave offering \textit{before} Adonai from the ram of the consecration offering; it \textit{was} Moses’ share, \textit{just} as Adonai had commanded Moses.
\verseWithHeading{Anointing the Priests and Their Garments} Then Moses took \textit{some of} the anointing oil and \textit{some of} the blood that \textit{was} on the altar, and he spattered \textit{them} on Aaron, on his garments, and on Aaron’s sons and on his sons’ garments with him—thus he consecrated Aaron, his garments, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.
\verse Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat in \textit{the} entrance to \textit{the} tent of assembly, and there you must eat it and the bread that \textit{is} in the basket of the consecration offering, \textit{just} as I have commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons must eat it,’
\verse but the remainder of the meat and the bread you must burn in the fire.
\verse And you must not go out from the entrance to \textit{the} tent of assembly \textit{for} seven days, until \textit{the} day of fulfilling the days of your consecration, because \textit{it will take seven days to ordain you}.
\verse \textit{Just} as was done on this day, Adonai commanded to be done \textit{in order} to make atonement for you.
\verse And you must stay \textit{at the} entrance to \textit{the} tent of assembly day and night \textit{for} seven days, and you shall keep the obligation from Adonai, so you might not die, for thus I have been commanded.”
\verse So Aaron and his sons did all the things that Adonai had commanded \textit{through} Moses.

\begin{biblechapter} % Leviticus 9
\verseWithHeading{Worship at the Tent of Assembly} Then on the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and Israel’s elders,
\verse and he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself \textit{a bull calf} as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, without defect, and present \textit{them} \textit{before} Adonai.
\verse Then you must speak to the \textit{Israelites}, saying, ‘Take \textit{a he-goat} as a sin offering and a bull calf and a male sheep, \textit{yearlings} without defect, as a burnt offering,
\verse and an ox and a ram as fellowship offerings to sacrifice \textit{before} Adonai, and a grain offering mixed with oil, because today Adonai will appear to you.”
\verse So they took what Moses had commanded to \textit{the} \textit{front of} \textit{the} tent of assembly, and the whole community presented \textit{themselves}, and they stood \textit{before} Adonai.
\verse Then Moses said, “This \textit{is} the word that Adonai commanded you to do \textit{so that} the glory of Adonai might appear to you.”
\verse Then Moses said to Aaron, “Approach the altar and \textit{sacrifice} your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. And \textit{sacrifice} the people’s offering and make atonement for them, \textit{just} as Adonai has commanded.”
\verse Then Aaron approached the altar, and he slaughtered the bull calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
\verse Then Aaron’s sons presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, and he put \textit{it} on the altar’s horns, and he poured out the blood on the altar’s base.
\verse And the fat and the kidneys and the lobe \textit{from the sin offering’s liver} he turned into smoke on the altar, \textit{just} as Adonai had commanded Moses,
\verse but the meat and the skin he burned \textit{with fire} \textit{outside the camp}.
\verse Then he slaughtered the burnt offering, and Aaron’s sons brought the blood to him, and he sprinkled it on the altar all around;
\verse and they brought the burnt offering to him by its pieces, as well as the head, and he turned \textit{them} into smoke on the altar;
\verse and he washed the inner parts and the lower leg bones, then he turned \textit{them} into smoke upon the burnt offering on the altar.
\verse Then he presented the people’s offering, and he took the goat of the sin offering, which \textit{was} for the people, and he slaughtered it and offered it \textit{as} a sin offering like the first one.
\verse Then he presented the burnt offering, and he \textit{sacrificed} it according to the regulation.
\verse Then he presented the grain offering, and he filled his palm \textit{with some of} it, and he turned it into smoke on the altar besides the morning’s burnt offering.
\verse Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the fellowship offerings that \textit{are} for the people, and Aaron’s sons brought the blood to him, and he sprinkled it on the altar all around.
\verse And \textit{as for} the fat portions from the ox and from the ram (the fat tail and the layer of fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver),
\verse they placed the fat portions on the breast sections, and he turned the fat portions into smoke on the altar.
\verse Then Aaron waved the breast sections and the right upper thigh \textit{as} a wave offering \textit{before} Adonai, \textit{just} as Moses had commanded.
\verse Then Aaron lifted his hand toward the people, and he blessed them, and he came down \textit{after} \textit{sacrificing} the sin offering and the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.
\verse Then Moses and Aaron entered \textit{the} tent of assembly. When they came out, they blessed the people, and Adonai’s glory appeared to all the people.
\verse Then a fire went out \textit{from before} Adonai, and it consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And all the people saw \textit{it}, so they shouted \textit{for joy}, and they fell on their faces.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Leviticus 10
\verseWithHeading{The Deaths of Nadab and Abihu} And Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu each took his censer, and they put fire in them and placed incense on it; then they presented \textit{before} Adonai illegitimate fire, which he had not commanded them.
\verse So fire went out \textit{from before} Adonai, and it consumed them so that they died \textit{before} Adonai.
\verse Therefore Moses said to Aaron, “This \textit{is} what Adonai spoke, saying, ‘Among those who are close to me I will show myself holy, and \textit{in the presence of} all the people I will display my glory.’ ” So Aaron was silent.
\verse Then Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan the sons of Uzziel, Aaron’s uncle, and he said to them, “Come forward. Carry your brothers from \textit{the front of} the sanctuary to \textit{outside the camp}.”
\verse So they came forward, and they carried them \textit{outside the camp} in their tunics, just as Moses had ordered.
\verse Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “You must not let your hair hang loosely, and you must not tear your garments, so that you will not die and he will be angry with all the community. But your brothers, all the house of Israel, may weep \textit{because of} \textit{the burning that Adonai caused},
\verse but you must not go out from \textit{the} entrance to \textit{the} tent of assembly lest you die, because Adonai’s anointing oil \textit{is} on you.” So they did according to Moses’ word.
\verseWithHeading{Lasting Statutes} Then Adonai spoke to Aaron, saying,
\verse “You and your sons with you may not drink wine or strong drink when you come to \textit{the} tent of assembly, so that you will not die—\textit{it is} a lasting statute for your generations—
\verse and to distinguish between the holy and the unholy, as well as between the unclean and the clean,
\verse and to teach the \textit{Israelites} all the rules that Adonai has spoken to them \textit{through} Moses.”
\verse Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “\textit{As for} the remaining \textit{parts}, take the remainder \textit{of} the grain offering from Adonai’s offerings made by fire and eat it, \textit{the} unleavened bread, beside the altar, because it \textit{is} \textit{a most holy thing}.
\verse And you shall eat it in a holy place, because it \textit{is} your allotted portion and the allotted portion of your sons from Adonai’s offerings made by fire, for so I have been commanded.
\verse And the wave offering’s breast section and the upper thigh of the contribution \textit{offering} you must eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, because they are given \textit{as} your allotted portion and your sons’ allotted portion from the sacrifices of the \textit{Israelites}’ fellowship offerings.
\verse They must bring the thigh of the contribution \textit{offering} and the breast section of the wave offering in addition to the offerings made by fire, \textit{consisting} of the fat portions, to wave as a wave offering \textit{before} Adonai; and it will be for you and for your sons with you as a lasting rule, \textit{just} as Adonai had commanded.”
\verseWithHeading{The Problem of the Uneaten Sin Offering} Then Moses sought all over \textit{for} the goat of the sin offering and behold, it was burned up. So he was angry with Aaron’s remaining sons Eleazar and Ithamar, saying,
\verse “Why did you not eat the sin offering on the sanctuary’s site, because it \textit{is} \textit{a most holy thing}? And he gave it to you to remove the community’s guilt, to make atonement for them \textit{before} Adonai.
\verse Look, its blood was not brought \textit{inside the sanctuary}. Certainly you should have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.”
\verse So Aaron said to Moses, “Look, today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering \textit{before} Adonai, and \textit{things} such as these have happened to me, and \textit{if} I were to eat a sin offering today, would it have been good in Adonai’s eyes?”
\verse When Moses heard, it was good in his eyes.

\verse And on the first day you shall take for yourselves the first fruit of majestic trees, branches of palm trees and branches of a leafy tree and of a brook’s poplar trees, and you shall rejoice \textit{before} Adonai your God \textit{for} seven days.
\verse And you must hold it \textit{as} a festival for Adonai \textit{for} seven days in the year; \textit{it shall be} a \textit{lasting statute} throughout your generations; in the seventh month you must hold it.
\verse You must live in the booths \textit{for} seven days; all the natives in Israel must live in the booths,
\verse so that your generations shall know that I made the \textit{Israelites} live in booths when I brought them from the land of Egypt; I \textit{am} Adonai your God.’ ”
\verse Thus Moses announced to the \textit{Israelites} Adonai’s appointed times.

\verse On the pure \textit{golden} lampstand he shall arrange for the lamps \textit{before} Adonai continually.
\verse “And you shall take finely milled flour, and you shall bake \textit{with} it twelve ring-shaped bread cakes: each one \textit{shall be} two-tenths \textit{of an ephah}.
\verse And you shall place them \textit{in} two rows, six \textit{to the} row, on the pure \textit{gold} table \textit{before} Adonai.
\verse And you shall put pure frankincense on each row so that it shall be for the bread as a memorial offering, an offering made by fire for Adonai.
\verse \textit{On every Sabbath} he shall arrange it in rows \textit{before} Adonai continually; \textit{they are} from the \textit{Israelites} \textit{as} an everlasting covenant.
\verse And it shall be for Aaron and for his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place, because it \textit{is} \textit{a most holy thing} for him from Adonai’s offerings made by fire—a \textit{lasting rule}.”
\verseWithHeading{Punishment for Blasphemy} And an Israelite woman’s son, and he \textit{was} an Egyptian man’s son, went out in the midst of the \textit{Israelites}; and the Israelite woman’s son and an Israelite man fought in the camp.
\verse Then the Israelite woman’s son blasphemed the name, and he cursed, so they brought him to Moses—and the name of his mother \textit{was} Shelomith the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
\verse Then they put him in custody \textit{so that} \textit{the matter} might be made clear to them in accordance with the mouth of Adonai.
\verse Then Adonai spoke to Moses, saying,
\verse “Bring the curser \textit{outside the camp}, and all the hearers shall place their hands on his head, and the whole community shall stone him.
\verse And you shall speak to the \textit{Israelites}, saying, ‘\textit{Any man} when he curses his God shall bear his sin.
\verse And he who blasphemes Adonai’s name certainly shall be put to death; the whole community certainly shall stone him. As the alien, so the native shall be put to death at blaspheming his name.
\verse “ ‘And when a man kills any human being, he certainly shall be put to death.
\verse And \textit{he who kills} a domestic animal must repay \textit{for} it life in place of life.
\verse And when a man \textit{causes} a physical defect in his fellow citizen \textit{according to} what he has done, so it shall be done to him:
\verse fracture in place of fracture, eye in place of eye, tooth in place of tooth—\textit{according to} \textit{the} physical defect he \textit{causes} to the person, likewise it shall be \textit{caused} to him.
\verse And a killer of a domestic animal must repay \textit{for} it, and a killer of a human shall be put to death.
\verse \textit{You must have} one norm; as \textit{for} the alien, so it must be \textit{for} the native, because I \textit{am} Adonai your God.’ ”
\verse Thus Moses spoke to the \textit{Israelites}, and they brought the curser \textit{outside the camp}, and they stoned him \textit{with} stones, and the \textit{Israelites} did \textit{just} as Adonai had commanded Moses.

\verse Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and you shall gather its yield.
\verse But in the seventh year it shall be \textit{a Sabbath of complete rest} for the land—a Sabbath for Adonai; you must not sow your field, and you must not prune your vineyard.
\verse You must not reap your harvest’s aftergrowth, and you must not harvest the grapes of your unpruned vines—it shall be \textit{a year of complete rest} for the land.
\verse And a Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you: for you and for your slave and for your slave woman and for your hired worker and for your temporary residents who are dwelling as aliens with you;
\verse and all its yield shall be for your domestic animal and for the wild animal, which \textit{are} in your land to eat.
\verseWithHeading{The Year of Jubilee} “ ‘And you shall count for yourself seven Sabbaths of years, seven times seven years, and they shall be for you \textit{time periods of} years: \textit{forty-nine} years.

\verse And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and you shall proclaim a release in the land for all its inhabitants. It \textit{is} a Jubilee; it shall be for you, and you shall return. You must return—everyone to his property and everyone to his clan.
\verse \textit{You shall have the fiftieth year as a Jubilee}; you must not reap its aftergrowth, and you must not harvest its unpruned vines.
\verse Because it is a Jubilee, it shall be holy to you. You must eat its produce from the field.
\verse “ ‘In this Year of Jubilee \textit{each of you shall return} to his property.
\verse And when you sell something to your fellow citizen or \textit{you} buy from your neighbor’s hand, you must not oppress \textit{one another}.

\verse You must increase its price \textit{according to a greater number of years}, but you must decrease its price \textit{according to a lesser number of years}, because he is selling \textit{its} yields to you.
\verse And you must not oppress \textit{one another}, but you shall revere your God, because I \textit{am} Adonai, your God.
\verse “ ‘And you shall do my statutes, and you must keep my regulations, and you shall do them, so that you shall live \textit{securely} on the land.
\verse And the land shall give its fruit, and you shall eat \textit{your fill}, and you shall live \textit{securely} on it.
\verse And if you should say, “What shall we eat in the seventh year, \textit{if} we do not sow and we do not gather its yield?”
\verse then I will command my blessing for you in the sixth year, so that it will make the yield for three years.

\verse “ ‘But the land must not be sold in perpetuity, because the land \textit{is} mine, because you \textit{are} aliens and temporary residents with me.

\verse However, village houses that have no surrounding wall shall be considered \textit{open country}; \textit{there} is redemption for it, and in the Jubilee it shall go out \textit{of the buyer’s hand}.
\verse “ ‘As for the cities of the Levites, \textit{that is}, the houses in their property’s cities, it shall be \textit{a lasting redemption} for the Levites.
\verse And whatever \textit{anyone} redeems from the Levites then must go out \textit{of the buyer’s hand} in the Jubilee, \textit{including} a house’s selling \textit{in his city’s property}, because the houses in the cities of the Levites \textit{are} their property in the midst of the \textit{Israelites}.
