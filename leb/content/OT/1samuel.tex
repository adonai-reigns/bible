\begin{biblechapter} % 1 Samuel 1
\verseWithHeading{The Family of Elkanah} There was a certain man from Ramathaim Zophim, from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
\verse He had two wives; the name of the first \textit{was} Hannah, and the name of the second \textit{was} Peninnah. Now Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
\verse Now this man used to go up from his town \textit{year by year} to worship and to sacrifice to Adonai of hosts in Shiloh, \textit{where} the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, \textit{were} priests to Adonai.
\verse \textit{On} the day Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.
\verse But to Hannah he would give \textit{a double portion}, because he loved Hannah, though Adonai had closed her womb.
\verse (Now her rival wife would provoke her severely in order to upset her because Adonai had closed her womb.)
\verse And so he used to do year after year; \textit{whenever} she went up to the house of Adonai, she would provoke her so that she would weep and would not eat.
\verse So Elkanah her husband would say to her: “Hannah, why do you weep and why do you not eat? And \textit{why are you heartsick}? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”
\verse Then Hannah got up after eating and drinking at Shiloh. (Now Eli the priest \textit{was} sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the temple of Adonai.)
\verse She \textit{was} \textit{deeply troubled}, so she prayed to Adonai and wept bitterly.
\verse She \textit{made a vow} and said: “O Adonai of hosts, if you will look with compassion on the misery of your female servant, and will remember me, and not forget your female servant, and will give to your female servant \textit{a male child} then I will give him to Adonai all the days of his life, and a razor will never pass over his head.”
\verse \textit{While} she continued to pray before Adonai, Eli was observing her mouth.
\verse Now Hannah had been speaking in her heart; her lips \textit{were} moving, but her voice could not be heard, so Eli considered her \textit{to be} drunk.
\verse Then Eli said to her, “How long will you behave like someone \textit{who is} drunk? Put away your wine!”
\verse But Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord. I am a woman \textit{deeply distressed}, but I have not drunk wine \textit{or} strong drink. \textit{Rather}, I have poured out my soul before Adonai.
\verse Do not regard your female servant as \textit{worthless}, but because of the extent of my worries and my provocation I have spoken all of this.”
\verse Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have asked of him.”
\verse And she said, “May your female slave find favor in your sight.” Then the woman went on her way and ate \textit{something}, and \textit{her face did not look sad any longer}.
\verseWithHeading{The Birth of Samuel} Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped before Adonai \textit{and returned} to their house at Ramah. Then Elkanah \textit{had sexual relations with} Hannah his wife, and Adonai remembered her.
\verse \textit{In due time}, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She called his name Samuel, for \textit{she said}, “I requested him from Adonai.”
\verse So the man Elkanah went up with all his household \textit{to make the annual sacrifice} to Adonai and \textit{to pay} his vow.
\verse But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “Once the boy \textit{is} weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear before Adonai; and he will remain there forever.”
\verse So her husband Elkanah said to her, “\textit{Do what seems right to you}; stay until you wean him. Only may Adonai fulfill his word.” So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.
\verse Then she brought him up with her when she had weaned him, \textit{along} with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. She brought him to the house of Adonai at Shiloh while the boy \textit{was still} young.
\verse They slaughtered the bull, and they brought the boy to Eli.
\verse She said, “Excuse me, my lord. As \textit{you live}, my lord, I \textit{am} the woman who stood with you in this \textit{place} to pray to Adonai.
\verse I prayed for this boy, and Adonai has given me my request that I asked from him.
\verse I in turn have lent him to Adonai. \textit{As long as he lives} he \textit{is} lent to Adonai.” Then they worshiped Adonai there.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % 1 Samuel 2
\verse Then Hannah prayed and said,
\verse “My heart exults in Adonai, my strength \textit{is} exalted in Adonai; \textit{I grin} over my enemies, for I rejoice over your salvation.
\verse There is no one holy like Adonai, for there is no one besides you, 
and there is no rock like our God.
\verse Do not increase speaking \textit{very proud} words! 
Let no arrogance go forth from your mouth, 
for Adonai is a God of knowledge 
\textit{whose} deeds are not weighed.
\verse The bows of mighty warriors \textit{are} shattered, 
but those who stumble gird \textit{themselves with} strength.
\verse Those who were full must hire themselves out for bread, 
but those who are hungry will become fat. 
As for the infertile, she will bear seven, 
but \textit{she who has} many sons withers away.
\verse Adonai kills and restores alive, 
he brings down \textit{to} Sheol and raises up.
\verse Adonai makes poor and makes rich; 
he brings low and also exalts.
\verse He raises up the poor from \textit{the} dust. 
From \textit{the} ash heap he lifts up the needy, 
to cause them to sit with noble people 
and to cause them to inherit a seat of honor. 
For the pillars of the earth belong to Adonai 
and he has set the inhabited world on them.
\verse He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, 
but the wicked will be destroyed in the darkness, 
because a man will not prevail by \textit{his} might.
\verse Then Elkanah went to Ramah, to his house. Now the boy was serving Adonai \textit{in the presence of} Eli the priest.
\verseWithHeading{The Family of Eli the Priest} Now the sons of Eli \textit{were} \textit{worthless scoundrels}; they did not know Adonai.
\verse And the custom of the priests with the people \textit{was this}: When any man \textit{brought a sacrifice}, as the meat was boiling, the servant of the priest would take a three-pronged meat fork in his hand
\verse and would thrust it into the pan or into the kettle or into the cauldron or into the cooking pot. All that the meat fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This \textit{is} what they used to do to all of the Israelites who came there at Shiloh.
\verse Also, before they \textit{offered up} the fat as a burnt offering, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the priest meat for roasting, for he will not take boiled meat from you, but only \textit{raw}.”
\verse And \textit{if} the man said to him, “Let them burn the fat completely \textit{first}, then take for yourself as \textit{you} desire,” then he would say to him, “No! Give it now! If not, I will take it by force!”
\verse So the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of Adonai, because the men treated the offering of Adonai with contempt.
\verseWithHeading{Samuel’s Life in the Tabernacle} Now Samuel \textit{was} serving before Adonai, as a boy wearing a linen ephod.
\verse His mother used to make for him a small robe and take it to him \textit{year by year} whenever she came up with her husband to offer the \textit{annual sacrifice}.
\verse And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and he said, “May Adonai give you an offspring from this woman in place of the petitioned \textit{one} that she requested from Adonai.” Then they went to their home.
\verse Adonai took note of Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters, while the young man Samuel grew up with Adonai.
\verseWithHeading{Eli Rebukes His Evil Sons} Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel and that they \textit{were} having sexual relations with the women who \textit{were} serving \textit{at} the entrance of \textit{the} tent of assembly.
\verse And he asked them, “Why are you doing all these things that I am hearing, \textit{namely}, your evil dealings with all these people?
\verse No, my sons, the report \textit{is} not good that I am hearing the people of Adonai spreading.
\verse If a man sins against a man, then God can intercede for him. But if a man sins against Adonai, who can intercede for him?” But they did not \textit{obey} their father, because Adonai wanted to kill them.
\verse But the boy Samuel \textit{continued to grow in stature and in favor} with Adonai and with the people.
\verseWithHeading{Adonai Rebukes Eli} Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him: “Thus says Adonai: ‘Did I not clearly reveal myself to the house of your ancestor when they were in Egypt under the house of Pharaoh?
\verse And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be a priest to me, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to bear an ephod before me. I gave to the house of your ancestor all the offerings made by fire by the \textit{Israelites}.
\verse Why do you despise my sacrifice and my offering which I commanded \textit{for my} dwelling place, while you honored your sons more than me by making yourselves fat from the best of all the offerings of my people Israel?
\verse Therefore,’ \textit{declares} Adonai the God of Israel, ‘though I solemnly said that your house and the house of your ancestor would walk before me forever, but now,’ \textit{declares} Adonai, ‘far be it from me, for those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me, I will treat with contempt!
\verse Look, days \textit{are} coming when I will cut off your \textit{strength} and the \textit{strength} of the house of your ancestor \textit{so that no one in your house will live to old age}.
\verse You will look at the distress of my dwelling place, \textit{despite} all the good caused for Israel, but there will never be an old \textit{man} in your household \textit{forever}!
\verse The only one I will not cut off from my altar \textit{is you}. \textit{Rather}, to cause your eyes to fail and to cause your soul to grieve, \textit{all the members of your household} will die \textit{as} men.
\verse This \textit{is} the sign for you that will come regarding your two sons Hophni and Phinehas: they will both die on the same day!
\verse But I will raise up for myself a reliable priest; he will do just according to what \textit{is} in my heart and in my soul. I will build for him a lasting house and he will walk continually before my anointed one \textit{forever}.
\verse All the remainder of your household will come to bow down \textit{before} him for a bit of silver or a loaf of bread and will say, “Please assign me to one of the \textit{priestly offices} so that I can eat a morsel of bread.” ’ ”
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % 1 Samuel 3
\verseWithHeading{Samuel’s First Encounter with Adonai} Now the boy Samuel was serving Adonai \textit{in the presence} of Eli. The word of Adonai was rare in those days; visions were not widespread.
\verse \textit{And then} one day when Eli was lying in his place (now his eyes had begun \textit{to grow} weak so that he was not able to see)
\verse and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, Samuel was lying in the temple of Adonai where the ark of God \textit{was}.
\verse Then Adonai called out to Samuel and he said, “Here I am!”
\verse And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.” But he said, “I did not call \textit{you}. Go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down.
\verse And Adonai called Samuel again, so Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.” And he said, “I did not call you, my son. Go back \textit{and} lie down.”
\verse Now Samuel did not yet know Adonai, and the word of Adonai had not yet been revealed to him.
\verse Again Adonai called Samuel a third time, so he got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.” Then Eli realized that Adonai was calling the boy.
\verse So Eli said to Samuel “Go lie down. \textit{If he calls} to you, then you must say, ‘Speak Adonai, because your servant \textit{is} listening.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
\verse Then Adonai came and stood \textit{there} and called out \textit{as before}, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, because your servant \textit{is} listening.”
\verse So Adonai said to Samuel, “Look, I am doing something in Israel \textit{which will cause} the two ears of everyone who hears it to tingle.
\verse On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken against his household, \textit{from beginning to end}.
\verse I will make him know that I am about to judge his household forever because of the iniquity that he knew, for his sons \textit{were} bringing curses on themselves, but he did not rebuke them.
\verse Therefore I swore to the house of Eli \textit{that} the iniquity of the house of Eli would not be atoned for by sacrifice or by offering forever.”
\verse So Samuel lay down until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of Adonai, but Samuel was afraid of telling the vision to Eli.
\verse Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!” And he said, “Here I am.”
\verse And he said, “What \textit{is} the message that he spoke to you? Please do not conceal \textit{it} from me. May God \textit{punish you severely} if you conceal anything from me of all the words that he told you.”
\verse So Samuel told him all the words and did not conceal \textit{anything} from him. And he said, “He \textit{is} Adonai, he will do \textit{what is} good in his \textit{sight}.”
\verse And Samuel grew up, and Adonai was with him. \textit{He did not allow any of his prophecies to go unfulfilled}.
\verse All Israel from Dan to Beersheba realized that Samuel was faithful as a prophet to Adonai.
\verse And Adonai appeared again in Shiloh, for Adonai revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the word of Adonai.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % 1 Samuel 4
\verseWithHeading{The Battle of Aphek} And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to meet \textit{the} Philistines for battle, and they encamped at Ebenezer, and \textit{the} Philistines encamped at Aphek.
\verse \textit{The} Philistines lined up for the battle to meet Israel, and the battle was prolonged until Israel was defeated before \textit{the} Philistines, \textit{who} killed about four thousand men \textit{on the battlefield}.
\verse When the army came \textit{back} to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why has Adonai defeated us today before \textit{the} Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of Adonai to us from Shiloh so that it may come into our midst and deliver us from the hand of our enemies.”
\verse So the army sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of Adonai of hosts who sits \textit{between} the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, \textit{were} there with the ark of the covenant of God.
\verse Now when the ark of the covenant of Adonai arrived at the camp, all Israel \textit{let out a loud shout} so that the earth shook.
\verse When \textit{the} Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, “What \textit{is} the noise of this loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?” Then they learned that the ark of Adonai had come into the camp.
\verse So \textit{the} Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come to the camp.” And they said, “Woe to us, \textit{for this has never happened before!}
\verse Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These \textit{are} the \textit{same} gods who struck the Egyptians with all \textit{sorts of} plagues in the desert.
\verse Take courage and be men, \textit{you} Philistines, lest you end up serving the Hebrews just like they have served you. Be men and fight!”
\verse So \textit{the} Philistines fought and Israel was defeated and each man fled to his tent, for the slaughter was very great. Thirty thousand foot soldiers from Israel fell.
\verse Furthermore, the ark of God was captured, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
\verse A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came \textit{to} Shiloh that same day, and his clothes \textit{were} torn and earth \textit{was} on his head.
\verse When he came, \textit{there was} Eli sitting on his chair \textit{by the side of the road} watching, because his heart was anxious about the ark of God. Now the man had come \textit{to give his report} in the city, and all the city cried out.
\verse When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, “What \textit{is} the noise of this commotion?” Then the man \textit{came quickly} and told Eli.
\verse Now Eli \textit{was} \textit{ninety-eight years old} and his eyes \textit{stayed fixed ahead} and he was not able to see.
\verse And the man said to Eli, “I am the \textit{one} who has come from the battle line! I have fled today from the battle line!” And he said, “\textit{What exactly happened}, my son?”
\verse Then the messenger answered and said, “Israel has fled before \textit{the} Philistines. There has been a great defeat among the troops. Also, your two sons have died, Hophni and Phinehas, and the ark of God has been captured.”
\verse Just as he mentioned the ark of God, he fell from his chair backwards against the side of the gate. He broke his neck and died, because the man was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.
\verse Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, \textit{was} pregnant and \textit{about} to give birth. When she heard the news concerning the capture of the ark of God and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she \textit{went into labor} and gave birth, because her labor pains came upon her.
\verse Just before the time of her death, those \textit{attending her} said, “Do not fear, for you have given birth to a son.” But she did not answer, or \textit{pay any attention}.
\verse She called the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel,” referring to the capture of the ark of God and concerning her father-in-law and husband.
\verse And she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God was captured.”
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % 1 Samuel 5
\verseWithHeading{The Ark of the Covenant among the Philistines} Now \textit{the} Philistines had captured the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
\verse Then \textit{the} Philistines took the ark of God and brought it to the temple of Dagon and placed it beside Dagon.
\verse When the Ashdodites got up early the next morning, \textit{there was} Dagon fallen with his face to the ground before the ark of Adonai! So they took Dagon and returned him to his place.
\verse When they got up early in the morning the next day, \textit{there was} Dagon fallen \textit{again} with his face to the ground before the ark of Adonai! The head of Dagon and the palms of his two hands were cut off, lying at the threshold; only \textit{the body} of Dagon was left.
\verse (Therefore the priests of Dagon and all who come into the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod until this \textit{very} day.)
\verse Now the hand of Adonai was heavy against the Ashdodites and he destroyed them and struck them with tumors, both in Ashdod and its territories.
\verse The men of Ashdod saw \textit{that} it \textit{was} so, and they said, “The ark of the God of Israel should not remain with us, because his hand \textit{is} harsh on us and on Dagon our god!”
\verse So they sent and gathered all the rulers of \textit{the} Philistines to them, and they asked, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” And they said, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around toward Gath.” So they moved the ark of the God of Israel \textit{to Gath}.
\verse After they moved it, the hand of Adonai was against the city, causing a very great confusion, and he struck the men of the city \textit{from the youngest to the oldest}, causing tumors to break out on them.
\verse So they sent the ark of God \textit{to} Ekron. But when the ark of God came \textit{to} Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought around the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people!”
\verse So they sent and gathered all the rulers of \textit{the} Philistines, and they said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it return to its place, so that it will not kill us and our people.” For a \textit{deadly confusion} was throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
\verse The men who did not die were struck with \textit{the} tumors, so that the cry of the city for help went up \textit{to} heaven.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % 1 Samuel 6
\verseWithHeading{The Return of the Ark of Covenant} Now the ark of Adonai had been in the territory of \textit{the} Philistines \textit{for} seven months,
\verse and \textit{the} Philistines called to the priests and to those who practiced divination, saying, “What should we do with the ark of Adonai? Inform us how we should send it to its place.”
\verse They said, “If you \textit{are} sending the ark of the God of Israel away, you must not send it away empty, but by all means return it with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and it will become known to you why his hand \textit{is} not turned aside from you.”
\verse And they said, “What \textit{is} the guilt offering that we should return to him?” They said, “The number of the rulers of \textit{the} Philistines \textit{is} five. Therefore send five gold tumors and five gold mice, because one plague \textit{was} on all of you and all your rulers.
\verse You must make images of your tumors and images of your mice that \textit{are} ravaging the land, and you must give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand on you and on your gods and on your land.
\verse Why should you harden your hearts like \textit{the} Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart? Is it not just like when he dealt with them wantonly so that they sent them away and they left?
\verse So then, \textit{prepare} one new utility cart and two milking cows that have never had a yoke on them, and you must harness the cows to the utility cart and then turn their calves from following them to their stall.
\verse And you must take the ark of Adonai and place it on the utility cart with the gold objects that you \textit{are} returning to him as a guilt offering. You must place \textit{them} in the container beside \textit{the ark} and then send it \textit{off} so that it goes away.
\verse You must watch; if it goes up by the way of its territory to Beth Shemesh, he has caused this great disaster to \textit{come on} us. But if not, then we will know his hand has not struck us; it \textit{was by} chance \textit{that} this happened to us.
\verse So the men did so; they took two milking cows and harnessed them to the utility cart, but they shut up their calves in the stall.
\verse Then they put the ark of Adonai on the utility cart with the container \textit{holding} the gold mice and the images of their tumors.
\verse The cows went straight on the way on the road to Beth Shemesh, on the one main road, \textit{lowing as they went}. They did not turn aside to the right or to the left, and the rulers of \textit{the} Philistines \textit{were} walking after them up to the border of Beth Shemesh.
\verse Now \textit{the people of} Beth Shemesh \textit{were} reaping the wheat harvest in the valley. They lifted their eyes and saw the ark, and they were glad to see \textit{it}.
\verse The utility cart came to the field of Joshua \textit{of} Beth Shemesh and stopped there where there \textit{was} a large stone. They split the wood of the utility cart and sacrificed the cows \textit{as} a burnt offering to Adonai.
\verse Then the Levites took down the ark of Adonai and the container that was beside it, in which \textit{were} the gold objects, and \textit{they} set them on the large stone. Then the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings, and they \textit{made} sacrifices to Adonai on that day.
\verse The five rulers of \textit{the} Philistines saw \textit{it} and returned \textit{to} Ekron that \textit{same} day.
\verse Now these \textit{are} the gold tumors which \textit{the} Philistines returned \textit{as} a guilt offering to Adonai: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron.
\verse And the gold mice \textit{according to} the number of all the cities of \textit{the} Philistines, for their five rulers, from \textit{the} fortified city to the unwalled village of the open country as far as the great stone, \textit{where they set} the ark of Adonai until this day in the field of Joshua \textit{of} Beth Shemesh.
\verse He struck seventy men among the men of Beth Shemesh because they looked into the ark of Adonai. So the people mourned because Adonai had struck a great blow among the people.
\verse Then the men of Beth Shemesh asked, “Who \textit{is} able to stand before Adonai, this holy God? And to whom shall it go up from us?”
\verse So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim saying, “\textit{The} Philistines have returned the ark of Adonai. Come down and take it up to yourselves.”
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % 1 Samuel 7
\verseWithHeading{Revival and Victory at Mizpah} The men of Kiriath Jearim came and brought up the ark of Adonai, and they brought it to the house of Abinadab in Gibeah. They consecrated Eleazer his son to guard the ark of Adonai.
\verse \textit{From} the day the ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim, \textit{days multiplied and became twenty years} while all the house of Israel mourned after Adonai.
\verse And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If with all your heart you \textit{are} turning to Adonai, remove the foreign gods and Ashtoreths from your midst. Commit your hearts to Adonai and serve him alone. Then he will deliver you from the hand of \textit{the} Philistines.”
\verse So the \textit{Israelites} removed the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and they served Adonai alone.
\verse Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to Adonai for you.”
\verse So they gathered to Mizpah and drew water and poured \textit{it} out before Adonai. They fasted on that day and said there, “We have sinned against Adonai!” So Samuel judged the \textit{Israelites} at Mizpah.
\verse \textit{Now} when \textit{the} Philistines heard that the \textit{Israelites} had gathered at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the \textit{Israelites} heard \textit{of it}, \textit{they were afraid of the Philistines}.
\verse Then the \textit{Israelites} said to Samuel, “\textit{You must not cease} from crying out to Adonai our God, so that he will deliver us from the hand of \textit{the} Philistines.”
\verse So Samuel took a single \textit{nursing lamb} and sacrificed \textit{it} as a whole burnt offering to Adonai. Then Samuel cried out to Adonai on behalf of Israel, and Adonai answered him.
\verse \textit{While} Samuel \textit{was} sacrificing the burnt offering, \textit{the} Philistines drew near for the battle against Israel. But Adonai thundered against \textit{the} Philistines with a great noise on that day and threw them into confusion so that they were defeated before Israel.
\verse Then the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued \textit{the} Philistines and they struck them down as far as below Beth Car.
\verse So Samuel took a single stone and put \textit{it} between Mizpah and Shen, and he named it Ebenezer and said, “Up to here Adonai has helped us.”
\verse So the Philistines were subdued and they did not come into the territory of Israel again, and the hand of Adonai was against \textit{the} Philistines all the days of Samuel.
\verse The towns which \textit{the} Philistines had taken from Israel \textit{were} returned to Israel from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territories from the hand of \textit{the} Philistines. Then there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
\verseWithHeading{The Circuit Ministry of Samuel} Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
\verse He used to go \textit{on the circuit} \textit{from year to year}. He went around Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he judged Israel \textit{in} all these places.
\verse Then \textit{he returned} to Ramah, because his house was there, and there he judged Israel, and he built an altar to Adonai there.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % 1 Samuel 8
\verseWithHeading{Israel’s Demand for a King} When Samuel grew old he appointed his sons as judges over Israel.
\verse The name of his firstborn son \textit{was} Joel, and the name of his second son \textit{was} Abijah. \textit{They were} judges in Beersheba.
\verse But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after gain, they took bribes, and they perverted justice.
\verse So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah.
\verse They said to him, “Look, you are old and your sons do not follow in your ways. So then appoint a king for us to judge us, like all the nations.
\verse But the matter \textit{was displeasing to Samuel} when they said, “Give us a king to judge us,” so Samuel prayed to Adonai.
\verse Then Adonai said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people concerning all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.
\verse Like all the deeds they have done from the day I brought them up from Egypt until this day, they have forsaken me and have served other gods—so they \textit{are} doing to you also.
\verse And so then, listen to their voice. However, you must earnestly warn them; you must explain to them the custom of the king who will rule over them.”
\verse So Samuel spoke all the words of Adonai to the people who \textit{were} requesting a king from him.
\verse He said, “This will be the custom of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and his horsemen, and they will run before his chariots.
\verse He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and \textit{those} \textit{to do his plowing} and to reap his harvest, and \textit{those} to make weapons of war and the equipment for his chariots.
\verse He will take your daughters as \textit{his} perfume makers and as cooks and as bakers.
\verse He will take the best of your fields and your vineyards and your olive trees and will give \textit{them} to his servants.
\verse He will take a tenth of your seed and your vineyards and give \textit{it} to his high officials and to his servants.
\verse He will take your male slaves and your female slaves and the best of your young men and your donkeys and \textit{will use them for his projects}.
\verse He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you \textit{yourselves} will become his servants.
\verse So you will cry out on that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but Adonai will not answer you on that day!”
\verse However, the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel and they said, “No, but there must be a king over us,
\verse so that we \textit{also} may be like all the nations, and our king may rule us and go out before us and fight our battles.”
\verse Now when Samuel heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of Adonai.
\verse Then Adonai said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice, and appoint a king for them.” So Samuel spoke to the men of Israel, “Each of you go to his \textit{own} town.”

\begin{biblechapter} % 1 Samuel 9
\verseWithHeading{Saul, the Requested King, Introduced} Now there was a man from Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjaminite, \textit{a very wealthy man}.
\verse He had a son whose name was Saul, a young and handsome man. There was not a man from the \textit{Israelites} more handsome than he \textit{was}; from his shoulders up, he was taller than all the people.
\verse Now the female donkeys of Kish the father of Saul got lost, and Kish said to Saul his son, “Please take one of the servants with you and get up; go and seek the female donkeys.”
\verse So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim; he passed through the land of Shalisha but they did not find \textit{them}. They passed through the land of Shaalim but they were not there. He passed through the land of Benjamin but did not find \textit{them}.
\verse When they entered the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who \textit{was} with him, “Come, let us return, lest my father cease \textit{caring about} the female donkeys and worry about us!”
\verse But he said to him, “Look, a man of God \textit{is} in this town, and the man \textit{is} honored. All that he says certainly comes true. So then let us go there; perhaps he will tell us about our journey on which we have gone.”
\verse So Saul said to his servant, “Look, we may go, but what should we bring to the man? For the bread \textit{is} gone from our bags, and there \textit{is} no present to bring to the man of God. What \textit{do we have} with us?”
\verse The servant again answered Saul and said, “Look, \textit{I have} in my hand a quarter shekel of silver! I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us our way.”
\verse (Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say: “Come, let us go up to the seer.” For the prophet of today was formerly called a seer.)
\verse So Saul said to his servant, “\textit{Your suggestion is a good one}. Come, let us go.” And they went to the town where the man of God \textit{was}.
\verse They \textit{were} going up the ascent of the town when they found young women going out to draw water. They said to them, “Is there the seer here?”
\verse They answered them and said, “There is. Look, \textit{he is} just in front of you! Hurry now, because he has come to the town today, because there \textit{is} a sacrifice for the people today at the high place.
\verse As soon as you enter the town, you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice. Then afterward the invited \textit{guests} will eat. So then, go up, because you will find him today!”
\verse So they went up to the town. As they \textit{were} entering into the middle of the town, Samuel was coming forth to meet them, to go up to the high place.
\verse Now Adonai \textit{had revealed this to} Samuel the day before Saul arrived, saying,
\verse “This time tomorrow I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you must anoint him as leader over my people Israel. He will deliver my people from the hand of \textit{the} Philistines. For I have seen \textit{the suffering of} my people, because their cry \textit{of distress} has come to me.”
\verse When Samuel saw Saul, Adonai answered him, “Here \textit{is} the man about whom I told you! This \textit{is the} one \textit{who} will govern my people.”
\verse Then Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate and said, “Please tell me, where \textit{is} the house of the seer?”
\verse Samuel answered Saul and said, “I \textit{am} the seer. Go up \textit{ahead of me} to the high place, and you will eat with me today; then I will send you away in the morning. I will tell you all that \textit{is} \textit{on your mind}.
\verse And as for your female donkeys that were lost \textit{three days ago}, \textit{do not be concerned about them}, because they have been found. For whom \textit{is} all the desire of Israel? Is it not for you and for all the house of your father?”
\verse Saul answered and said, “\textit{Am} I not a Benjaminite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the humblest of all the families of the tribes of Benjamin? Why do you speak to me \textit{in this way}?”
\verse So Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them to a room in the building and gave them a place at the head of \textit{the invited guests}. There were about thirty men.
\verse Then Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion that I gave to you, about which I said to you, ‘Keep it with you.’ ”
\verse So the cook took up the shank and what was on it and put it before Saul, and he said, “Look, \textit{the saved portion} \textit{is} placed \textit{before you}—eat, because it has been kept for you for the appointed time,” \textit{and he said}, “I have invited the people.” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
\verse When they came down from the high place to the town, he spoke with Saul on the roof.
\verse They got up early, \textit{and as dawn was breaking}, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, “Get up, so that I can send you away.” So Saul got up and the two of them, he and Samuel, went outside.
\verse As they were going down to the outskirts of the town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to pass on before us. When he has passed, you stand here \textit{a while}, so that I can make known to you \textit{the} word of God.”

\begin{biblechapter} % 1 Samuel 10
\verseWithHeading{Saul Is Anointed as King} Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it over his head and kissed him and said, “\textit{Has not} Adonai anointed you as leader over his inheritance?
\verse As you go from with me \textit{today}, you will find two men near the burial site of Rachel in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will say to you, ‘The female donkeys that you went to search for have been found.’ Now look, your father \textit{is no longer concerned about} the female donkeys and has begun worrying about you, saying, ‘What should I do about my son?’
\verse Then you will go on from there and further you will come to the oak of Tabor. There three men will meet you, who \textit{are} going up to God at Bethel. One will be carrying three male kid goats, one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and one will be carrying a skin of wine.
\verse \textit{They will ask how you are doing} and will give you two loaves, which you will take from their hand.
\verse After this, you will come to the Gibeah of God, where there are sentries of \textit{the} Philistines. \textit{Just as you enter} the town there, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place, with harp, tambourine, flute, and zither before them, and they will be prophesying.
\verse Then the Spirit of Adonai will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will turn into \textit{a different person}.
\verse When these signs come to you, do for yourself what your hand finds \textit{to do}, for God \textit{will be} with you.
\verse Then you will go down before me to Gilgal. Look, I am coming down to you to offer burnt offerings \textit{and to make} fellowship offerings. You must wait seven days until I come to you. Then I will let you know what you should do.”
\verse \textit{Just as he turned} his shoulder to depart from Samuel, God \textit{changed his} heart. And all these signs were fulfilled on that day.
\verse When they went from there to Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied among them.
\verse \textit{And when} all who knew him \textit{formerly} saw that he prophesied with prophets, the people said to one another, “What \textit{is} this \textit{that} has happened to the son of Kish? \textit{Is} Saul also among the prophets?”
\verse And a man from there responded and said, “And who \textit{is} their father?” Therefore it became a proverb: “\textit{Is} Saul also among the prophets?”
\verse When he finished prophesying, he went to the high place.
\verse Then Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” And he said, “To search \textit{for} the female donkeys; and when we saw none, we went to Samuel.”
\verse So Saul’s uncle said to him, “Please tell me, what did Samuel say to you?”
\verse Then Saul said to his uncle, “He told us for certain that the female donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingship \textit{of} which Samuel had spoken.
\verse Then Samuel summoned the people to Adonai at Mizpah,
\verse and he said to the \textit{Israelites}, “Thus says Adonai the God of Israel: ‘I brought Israel up from Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that \textit{were} oppressing you.’
\verse But you today have rejected your God who always delivers you from all of your calamities and your distresses. You have said to him, ‘No, but you must appoint a king over us!’ So then present yourselves before Adonai by your tribes and by your clans.”
\verse So Samuel brought near all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected by lot.
\verse Then he brought near the tribe of Benjamin according to its families, and the family of Matri was selected by lot. Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen, and they sought him, but he could not be found.
\verse So they inquired again of Adonai, “\textit{Did the man come here}?”  And Adonai said, “Look, he \textit{is} hiding himself among the baggage.”
\verse So they ran and took him from there, and when he took his stand among the people, he was taller than all the people from his shoulders and up.
\verse Then Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom Adonai has chosen? For there is no one like him among all the people!” And all the people shouted and said, “Long live the king!”
\verse Then Samuel told the people the custom of the kingship, and he wrote \textit{the rules} down on a scroll and laid \textit{it} before Adonai. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each to his own house.
\verse And Saul also went to his house at Gibeah, and the troops whose hearts God had touched went with him.
\verse However, some \textit{worthless men} said, “How can this \textit{man} deliver us?” So they despised him and brought no gift to him, but he kept silent.

\verseWithHeading{Saul Defeats the Ammonites} Now Nahash the Ammonite went up and encamped against Jabesh Gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “\textit{Make a treaty with us} and we will serve you.”
\verse But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this \textit{condition} \textit{I will make a treaty} with you, by gouging out the right eye of each of you, so that I can make it a disgrace for all Israel.”
\verse So the elders of Jabesh said to him, “Leave us alone for seven days so that we may send messengers in all the territory of Israel, and if there \textit{is} no deliverer for us, then we will come out to you.”
\verse When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, \textit{they reported these things to} the people. Then all the people lifted up their voices and wept.
\verse \textit{Just then}, Saul was coming from the field behind the cattle. Saul said, “What \textit{is the matter} with the people, that they \textit{are} weeping?” So they recounted to him the words of the men of Jabesh.
\verse Then the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and \textit{he became very angry}.
\verse So he took a yoke of oxen and cut them into pieces and sent \textit{them} throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying, “Whoever \textit{is} not going out after Saul and after Samuel, so will it be done to his oxen.” Then the fear of Adonai fell on the people and they went out as one man.
\verse He mustered them at Bezek; the \textit{Israelites} \textit{were} three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah \textit{were} thirty thousand.
\verse They said to the messengers who had come, “Thus you will say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: ‘Tomorrow deliverance for you will come \textit{when the sun is hot}.’ ” When the messengers went and told the men of Jabesh, they rejoiced.
\verse The men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you and you may do to us \textit{whatever seems good to you}.”
\verse \textit{And the} next day Saul placed the people \textit{in} three divisions. Then they came into the middle of the camp \textit{at the early morning watch} and struck down \textit{the Ammonites} until the heat of the day. It happened that the remainder were scattered \textit{so that no two among them remained together}.
\verse Then the people said to Samuel, “Who \textit{is} the one who asked, ‘Will Saul reign over us?’ Give the men to us that we may kill them.”
\verse But Saul said, “No one will be put to death on this day, because \textit{today} Adonai has provided deliverance in Israel.”
\verse Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal, and let us renew the kingship there.”
\verse So all the people went to Gilgal and they made Saul king there before Adonai in Gilgal. They sacrificed fellowship offerings there before Adonai. Then Saul rejoiced there greatly \textit{along with} all the men of Israel.

\begin{biblechapter} % 1 Samuel 12
\verseWithHeading{Samuel’s Charge to Israel} Then Samuel said to all Israel, “Look, I have listened to your voice regarding all that you have said to me, so I have set a king over you.
\verse And so then here \textit{is} the king walking about before you. Now I am old and gray, but my sons (look at them!) \textit{are} with you; and I have walked about before you from my youth until this day.
\verse Here I am! Testify against me before Adonai and before his anointed one! Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I exploited? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe, that I may shut my eyes \textit{regarding} him?–then I will restore it to you.”
\verse Then they said, “You have not exploited us or oppressed us, and you have not taken anything from the hand of anyone.”
\verse So he said to them, “Adonai \textit{is} witness against you, and his anointed one \textit{is} witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” Then they said, “\textit{He is} witness.”
\verse Then Samuel said to the people, “Adonai \textit{is witness}, who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your ancestors up from the land of Egypt.
\verse So then take your stand, so that I may judge you before Adonai with \textit{regard to} all the \textit{deeds of} justice of Adonai that he performed with both you and your ancestors.
\verse “When Jacob came to Egypt, your ancestors cried out to Adonai, so he sent Moses and Aaron, and they brought your ancestors out from Egypt and settled them in this place.
\verse But they forgot Adonai their God, so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the hosts of Hazor, and into the hand of \textit{the} Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
\verse So they cried out to Adonai and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken Adonai and have served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hand of our enemies and we will serve you!’
\verse So Adonai sent Jerub-Baal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel. Then he delivered you from the hand of your enemies all around, and you lived \textit{in} security.
\verse “And when you saw that Nahash, the king of \textit{the} \textit{Ammonites}, was coming against you, you said to me, ‘No! A king shall reign over us,’ although Adonai your God \textit{is} your king.
\verse So then look! \textit{Here is} the king you have chosen, for whom you have asked! Look, Adonai has placed a king over you!
\verse If you will fear Adonai, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not be rebellious against \textit{what Adonai says}, and both you and the king who rules over you will \textit{follow} after Adonai your God, \textit{all will be well}.
\verse But, if you do not listen to the voice of Adonai, and you rebel against \textit{what Adonai says}, then the hand of Adonai will be against you \textit{as it was} against your ancestors.
\verse So then take your stand again and see this great thing that Adonai \textit{is going to} do before your eyes.
\verse \textit{Is} the wheat harvest not today? I will call out to Adonai so that he still sends thunder and rain, so that you will know and will see that your wickedness \textit{is} great that you have done in the eyes of Adonai by asking for a king for yourselves.”
\verse So Samuel called out to Adonai, and Adonai brought thunder and rain that \textit{same} day, so all the people feared Adonai and Samuel greatly.
\verse Then all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to Adonai your God so that we will not die, because we have added to all our sins by requesting a king for ourselves.”
\verse And Samuel said to the people, “Do not fear! You have done all this evil; only do not turn aside from \textit{following} Adonai. But you must serve Adonai with all your heart.
\verse And do not turn aside after the triviality, which have no value and cannot deliver, for they are triviality.
\verse For Adonai will not forsake his people for the sake of his great name, because Adonai has decided to make you his \textit{own} people.
\verse Also, as for me, far be it from me \textit{that I should sin} against Adonai by ceasing to pray for you! I will instruct you in the good and righteous way.
\verse Only fear Adonai and serve him faithfully with all of your heart. For consider \textit{what great things he has done for you}.
\verse But if you continue to do wickedness, both you and your king will be swept away.”

\verseWithHeading{Saul Rules over Israel} Saul \textit{was thirty} \textit{years old} at the beginning of his reign, and he reigned \textit{forty-}two years over Israel.
\verse He chose for himself three thousand from Israel. Two thousand \textit{of these} were with Saul at Micmash in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. He sent away the rest of the people, each to his tent.
\verse Jonathan defeated the garrison of \textit{the} Philistines that \textit{was} at Geba, and \textit{the} Philistines heard \textit{about it}. Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”
\verse And all Israel did hear, saying, “Saul has defeated the garrison of \textit{the} Philistines; and also, Israel has become a stench among \textit{the} Philistines!” So the people were called out after Saul at Gilgal.
\verseWithHeading{Saul’s Blunder} And the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and an army as numerous as sand which \textit{is} on the seashore. And they came up and encamped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven.
\verse When the men of Israel saw that \textit{it was} \textit{too difficult} for them, because the army was hard pressed, the people hid themselves in the caves, in the thorn bushes, in the cliffs, in the vaults and in the wells.
\verse \textit{Some} of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the army \textit{followed him trembling}.
\verse He waited seven days according to the appointed time Samuel determined, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and \textit{the army started to slip away from him}.
\verse So Saul said, “Bring here to me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” Then he offered up the burnt offering.
\verse \textit{Just as} he finished offering the burnt sacrifice, Samuel was coming. So Saul went out to meet him \textit{and} to bless him.
\verse But Samuel said, “What have you done?” Saul said, “Because I saw that the army \textit{was scattering} from me and you did not come \textit{at the appointed time} and \textit{that the} Philistines had gathered at Micmash,
\verse therefore I said, ‘Now \textit{the} Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not yet implored the face of Adonai.’ So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering.”
\verse Then Samuel said to Saul, “You have behaved foolishly! You have not kept the command of Adonai your God which he commanded you. For then, Adonai would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.
\verse But now, your kingdom will not endure. Adonai has sought for himself a man according to his \textit{own} heart, and Adonai has appointed him as leader over his people, because you have not kept what Adonai commanded you.”
\verse Then Samuel got up and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul mustered the people who were found with him, about six hundred men.
\verse Saul and Jonathan his son and the army that remained with them \textit{were} staying in Geba \textit{of} Benjamin, and \textit{the} Philistines encamped at Micmash.
\verse The \textit{raiders} went out from the camp of \textit{the} Philistines \textit{in} three divisions. One division turned on the road to Ophrah toward the land of Shual.
\verse One division turned on the road to Beth Horon, and one turned on the road toward the border overlooking the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
\verse Now no skilled craftsman could be found in all the land of Israel, for \textit{the} Philistines had said, “So that the Hebrews cannot make swords or spears for themselves.”
\verse So all Israel \textit{went} down to \textit{the} Philistines, each to have his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, and his iron plowshare sharpened.
\verse The charge was \textit{two-thirds of a shekel} for the plowshare and for the mattock, and \textit{a third of a shekel for the pick} and for the axe, and to set the goading sticks.
\verse \textit{So} on \textit{the} day of battle, there was not a sword or a spear found in the hands of all the army that was with Saul and Jonathan, but \textit{Saul and his son Jonathan had them}.
\verse Now the garrison of \textit{the} Philistines went out to the pass of Micmash.

\verseWithHeading{Jonathan Leads the Counterattack} \textit{One day} Jonathan the son of Saul said to \textit{his armor bearer}, “Come and let us go over to the garrison of \textit{the} Philistines which \textit{is} over there.” But he did not tell his father.
\verse Now Saul \textit{was} staying at the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree that \textit{was} in Migron, and the troops that \textit{were} with him \textit{were} about six hundred men.
\verse Now Ahijah, the son of Ahitub (the brother of Ichabod), the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of Adonai at Shiloh, was carrying an ephod. The troops did not know that Jonathan had gone.
\verse Now between the passes where Jonathan sought to go over to the garrison of \textit{the} Philistines \textit{there was} a crag of rock \textit{on one side} and a crag of rock \textit{on the other}. The name of the one \textit{was} Bozez and the name of the other \textit{was} Seneh.
\verse The one crag on the north \textit{was} opposite Micmash and the other on the south \textit{was} opposite Geba.
\verse So Jonathan said to \textit{his armor bearer}, “Come, let us go over to the garrisons of these uncircumcised; perhaps Adonai will act for us, for there is no hindrance for Adonai to save by many or by few.”
\verse And \textit{his armor bearer} said, “Do all that \textit{is} in your heart \textit{that you are inclined to do}. \textit{I am with you all of the way}!
\verse Then Jonathan said, “Look, we \textit{are about to} go over to the men; and we will show ourselves to them.
\verse If they say to us: ‘Wait until we reach you,’ \textit{then we will stand as we are} and not go up to them.
\verse But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for Adonai has given them into our hand, and this \textit{will be} the sign for us.”
\verse So the two of them showed themselves to the garrison of \textit{the} Philistines, and \textit{the} Philistines said, “The Hebrews \textit{are} coming out from the holes in which they have hidden themselves.”
\verse Then the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and \textit{his armor bearer}, “Come up to us and we will show you something!” Then Jonathan said to \textit{his armor bearer}, “Come up after me, for Adonai has given them into the hand of Israel!”
\verse So Jonathan went up on his hands and his feet, with \textit{his armor bearer} after him. They fell before Jonathan and then \textit{his armor bearer} would kill them after him.
\verse So was the first attack \textit{in} which Jonathan and \textit{his armor bearer} killed about twenty men within about half of a furrow in an acre of \textit{an} open field.
\verse Then there was terror in the camp, in the open field, and among all the army of the garrison. Even the \textit{raiders} trembled. The earth shook, and it became \textit{a very great panic}.
\verse And the lookouts of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin saw \textit{that} the multitude \textit{surged back and forth}.
\verse Saul said to the troops that \textit{were} with him, “Please call the roll and see who has gone from us.” So they called the roll \textit{and found that} Jonathan and \textit{his armor bearer} were not \textit{present}.
\verse Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring near the ark of God” (for the ark of God was \textit{at that time} with the \textit{Israelites}).
\verse While Saul was still speaking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of \textit{the} Philistines \textit{increased more and more}, so Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand!”
\verse Then Saul and all the troops who were with him were assembled on command and came up to the battle, and look! Each \textit{Philistine’s} sword \textit{was} against his friend; \textit{and there was} a very great confusion.
\verse The Hebrews who had been for \textit{the} Philistines \textit{previously}, who had gone up with them into the camp all around, even they \textit{joined the Israelites} who were with Saul and Jonathan.
\verse All the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that \textit{the} Philistines had fled, so even they pursued them closely in the battle.
\verse So on that day Adonai delivered Israel, and the battle shifted to Beth Aven.
\verseWithHeading{Saul’s Oath Leads to Trouble} Now the men of Israel were hard pressed on that day, because Saul had made the army take an oath, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats \textit{any} food until evening, when I will have avenged myself on my enemies!” So none of the army tasted \textit{any} food.
\verse (Now all \textit{the people of} the land used to go into the forest, for there was honey on the surface of the ground.)
\verse When the army came to the forest, look! \textit{There was} honey flowing, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the army was afraid of the solemn oath.
\verse However, Jonathan had not heard about the oath of his father with the army, so he extended the end of the staff which was in his hand, and he dipped it into the honeycomb. Then he put his hand to his mouth and his eyes gleamed.
\verse Then a man from the army informed \textit{him} and said, “Your father made the army swear a solemn \textit{oath}, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food today,’ ” so the army \textit{is} exhausted.
\verse Then Jonathan said, “My father has brought trouble on the land! See now that my eyes have brightened because I have tasted a little of this honey.
\verse \textit{How much more could have been done} if the troops had eaten freely today from the plunder of their enemies that they had found! For now the loss among \textit{the} Philistines \textit{is} not great.”
\verse They defeated \textit{the} Philistines that day from Micmash to Aijalon, and the troops were very weary.
\verse Then the troops took the plunder: they took sheep and cattle and \textit{calves} and slaughtered \textit{them} on the ground and the troops ate \textit{them all} with the blood.
\verse So they reported \textit{it} to Saul, saying, “Look! The troops \textit{are} sinning against Adonai by eating \textit{the animals} with the blood!” And he said, “You have dealt treacherously! Roll to me a large stone \textit{today}!”
\verse Then Saul said, “Disperse \textit{yourselves} among the troops and say to them, ‘Bring to me each \textit{one} his ox and each his sheep and slaughter them in this \textit{place} and eat, but do not sin against Adonai by eating \textit{the animals} with the blood.’ ” So all the troops brought \textit{them}, each \textit{leading} his ox in his hand that night, and slaughtered \textit{it} there.
\verseWithHeading{Jonathan Rescued from His Father Saul} Then Saul built an altar to Adonai; \textit{it was the first altar he built} to Adonai.
\verse Saul said, “Let us go down after \textit{the} Philistines \textit{by} night, and let us plunder them until the morning light, and let us not leave \textit{alive} a man among them.” So they said, “Do all that \textit{is} good in your eyes.” But the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.”
\verse So Saul inquired of God, “Should I go down after \textit{the} Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?” But he did not answer him on that day.
\verse Then Saul said, “Come here, all \textit{you} leaders of the people, \textit{so that we find out} what the sin was this day.
\verse For as Adonai lives, who delivers Israel, \textit{I swear} that even if it \textit{is} in Jonathan my son, \textit{he will certainly die}!” But nobody from all the army answered him.
\verse Then he said to all Israel, “You will be \textit{on one side}, and I and my son Jonathan will be \textit{on the other}.” And the army said to Saul, “Do \textit{what is} good in your eyes.”
\verse Then Saul said to Adonai the God of Israel, “\textit{Render a decision perfectly}.” Jonathan and Saul were chosen \textit{by lot} and the people went out.
\verse Then Saul said, “Let them cast \textit{the lot} between me and my son Jonathan,” and Jonathan was chosen.
\verse So Saul said, “Tell me what you have done.” So Jonathan told him and said, “I \textit{merely tasted} a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am, I must die.”
\verse Then Saul said, “So may God do \textit{to me} and \textit{more}, you will certainly die today, Jonathan!”
\verse But the army said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die, who accomplished this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As Adonai lives, not a hair from his head will fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the army ransomed Jonathan and he did not die.
\verse Saul went up from \textit{pursuing the} Philistines, and \textit{the} Philistines went to their place.
\verse So Saul took the kingship over Israel, and he fought all around against his enemies, against Moab, against the \textit{Ammonites}, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. He inflicted punishment against all who rebelled.
\verse He acted bravely and defeated \textit{the} Amalekites and rescued Israel from the hand of those who plundered it.
\verse Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua; the names of his two daughters \textit{were as follows}: the name of the firstborn \textit{was} Merab and the younger \textit{was} Michal.
\verse The name of Saul’s wife \textit{was} Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz, and the name of the commander of his army \textit{was} Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.
\verse Now Kish \textit{was} the father of Saul, but Ner, the father of Abner, \textit{was} the son of Abiel.
\verse Warfare was severe against \textit{the} Philistines all the days of Saul. Whenever Saul saw \textit{anyone who was a mighty warrior} or \textit{any brave man}, he \textit{conscripted him into his service}.

\verseWithHeading{Israel Defeats the Amalekites} Then Samuel said to Saul, “Adonai sent me to anoint you as king over his people Israel. So then, \textit{listen to the words} of Adonai!
\verse Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘I have observed what Amalek did to Israel, \textit{how he opposed him} when he went up from Egypt.
\verse So then, go and attack Amalek and utterly destroy all that is his! You must not spare him, but kill both man and woman, both child and nursing infant, both ox and sheep, both camel and donkey.’ ”
\verse Saul summoned the army and mustered them at Telaim; two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah.
\verse Then Saul came up to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the wadi.
\verse Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, leave! Withdraw from among the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you with them. You have shown loyal love to all the \textit{Israelites} when they came up from Egypt.” So the Kenites left from among \textit{the} Amalekites.
\verse Then Saul defeated \textit{the} Amalekites from Havilah as one goes to Shur which \textit{is} \textit{east of} Egypt.
\verse He captured Agag the king of Amalek alive, but all the people he utterly destroyed with the \textit{edge} of the sword.
\verse However, Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and the cattle and the second \textit{best} of the young fatlings and \textit{all that was valuable}; they were not willing to utterly destroy them. But all the possessions that were despised or worthless, they utterly destroyed.
\verseWithHeading{Samuel Announces the Downfall of Saul} Then the word of Adonai came to Samuel, saying,
\verse “I regret that I made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and has not kept my word.” \textit{Samuel became angry}, and he cried out to Adonai all night.
\verse Then Samuel got up early in the morning to meet Saul. Samuel was told, “Saul has gone to Carmel, and look, he \textit{is} setting up a monument for himself.” Then he turned around and crossed over and went down to Gilgal.
\verse When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, “May you be blessed by Adonai! I have kept the word of Adonai.”
\verse But Samuel said, “Then what \textit{is} this bleating of the sheep \textit{that I hear} in my ears and the lowing of the cattle that I am hearing?”
\verse Saul said, “They have brought them from \textit{the} Amalekites; the troops spared the best of the sheep and the cattle in order to sacrifice them to Adonai your God. But the rest we have utterly destroyed.”
\verse Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stop and let me tell you what Adonai said to me last night.” So he said to him, “Speak.”
\verse Samuel said, “Even though you \textit{are} small in your \textit{own} eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? Adonai has anointed you as king over Israel.
\verse When Adonai sent you on your way, he said to you: ‘Go! You must utterly destroy the sinners, \textit{the} Amalekites, and you must fight against them until you have destroyed them.’
\verse Why did you not listen to the voice of Adonai and fall with shouting on the plunder? You have done evil in the sight of Adonai!”
\verse Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have listened to the voice of Adonai, and I have gone on the way that Adonai sent me! I brought Agag the king of Amalek, and the Amalekites I have utterly destroyed.
\verse The troops took from the plunder, sheep and cattle, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to Adonai your God at Gilgal.”
\verse Then Samuel said,
\verse “Is there \textit{as much} delight for Adonai in burnt offerings and sacrifices 
as \textit{there is} in \textit{obeying} Adonai? 
Look! \textit{To obey} \textit{is} better than sacrifice; 
to give heed than the fat of rams.
\verse Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned because I have transgressed \textit{the commandment of Adonai} and your words, for I feared the troops and I listened to their voice.
\verse So then, please pardon my sin and return with me \textit{so that I can worship} Adonai.”
\verse But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you, for you have rejected the word of Adonai, and he has rejected you from being king over Israel!”
\verse As Samuel turned around to go, he caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.
\verse Then Samuel said to him, “Adonai has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your neighbor \textit{who is better than you}.
\verse Moreover, the Glory of Israel will not break faith and will not regret, for he \textit{is} not a human that he should regret.”
\verse Then he said, “I have sinned! Now please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me \textit{so that I can worship} Adonai your God.”
\verse So Samuel returned after Saul, and Saul \textit{worshiped} Adonai.
\verse Then Samuel said, “Bring Agag the king of Amalek out to me!” Agag came to him confidently, for Agag thought, “Surely the bitterness of death \textit{is over}.”
\verse Samuel said,
\verse Then Samuel went to Ramah and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul.
\verse Samuel \textit{did not see Saul again} until the day of his death, but Samuel mourned over Saul, and Adonai regretted that he made Saul king over Israel.

\begin{biblechapter} % 1 Samuel 16
\verseWithHeading{David Is Anointed} Then Adonai said to Samuel, “\textit{How long} will you mourn about Saul? I have rejected him from being king over Israel! Fill up your horn \textit{with} oil and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have chosen a king for myself among his sons.”
\verse But Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears, he will kill me.” Adonai said, “You must take a heifer from the herd \textit{with you}, and you must say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to Adonai.’
\verse You will invite Jesse to the sacrifice and I will make known to you what you must do. You will anoint for me \textit{the one} whom I tell you.”
\verse So Samuel did what Adonai said. He came to Bethlehem, and the elders of the city came trembling to meet him. They said, “\textit{Have you come in peace}?”
\verse He said, “\textit{I come in} peace. I have come to sacrifice to Adonai. Sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” So he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
\verse \textit{When they came}, he saw Eliab and said, “Surely his anointed one \textit{is} before Adonai!”
\verse But Adonai said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For \textit{God does} not \textit{see} what man sees, for a man \textit{looks on the outward appearance}, but Adonai \textit{looks on the heart}.”
\verse Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel, and he said, “This one also Adonai has not chosen.”
\verse So Jesse made Shammah pass \textit{before Samuel}, but he said, “Adonai also has not chosen this one.”
\verse And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesse, “Adonai has not chosen any of these.”
\verse Then Samuel said to Jesse, “\textit{Are all the young men here}?” And he said, “The youngest still remains, but look, he \textit{is} shepherding the flock.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him, for we cannot \textit{sit down} until he comes here.”
\verse So he sent and brought him. Now he \textit{was} ruddy with beautiful eyes and of \textit{handsome} appearance. And Adonai said, “Arise, anoint him, for this \textit{is} he.”
\verse So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. Then the Spirit of Adonai rushed upon David from that day \textit{on}. Then Samuel got up and went to Ramah.
\verseWithHeading{Saul in Torment} Now the Spirit of Adonai departed from Saul and an evil spirit from Adonai tormented him.
\verse So the servants of Saul said to him, “Look please, an evil spirit from God \textit{is} tormenting you.
\verse Please, let our lord command your servants \textit{who are} before you! Let them seek a man skilled in playing on the lyre. \textit{When} the evil spirit from God \textit{is} upon you, he can play \textit{on it} and \textit{you will feel better}.”
\verse So Saul said to his servants, “Please select a man \textit{who plays a stringed instrument well} and bring \textit{him} to me.”
\verse One of the servants answered and said, “Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite \textit{who is} skillful in playing a stringed instrument, a \textit{brave man, a warrior, prudent in speech, and handsome}. And Adonai \textit{is} with him.”
\verse So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me David your son who \textit{is} with the sheep.”
\verse And Jesse took a donkey \textit{loaded with} bread and a skin of wine and one \textit{young goat} and sent \textit{them} to Saul by the hand of David his son.
\verse So David came to Saul and \textit{entered his service}. He loved him greatly and \textit{he became Saul’s armor bearer}.
\verse Then Saul sent \textit{word} to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand before me, because he has found favor \textit{in my sight}.”
\verse So whenever the \textit{evil} spirit from God came to Saul, David would take the stringed instrument and play it with his hand. Then \textit{it would bring relief} for Saul; \textit{he would feel better} and the evil spirit would depart from him.

\verseWithHeading{The Philistine Champion Taunts Israel} \textit{The} Philistines gathered their camps for battle and they were gathered \textit{at} Socoh which \textit{belongs} to Judah. They camped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes Dammim.
\verse Then Saul and the men of Israel were gathered and encamped in the valley of Elah, and they formed ranks \textit{for the} battle to meet \textit{the} Philistines.
\verse \textit{The} Philistines were standing on the hill on one side and \textit{the army of} Israel was standing on the hill on the other side with the valley between them.
\verse Then \textit{a champion} went out from the camps of \textit{the} Philistines, whose name was Goliath from Gath. His height was six cubits and a span.
\verse A bronze helmet was on his head, and he was clothed with scale body armor; the weight of the body armor was five thousand bronze shekels.
\verse Bronze greaves were on his legs, and a bronze javelin \textit{was slung} between his shoulders.
\verse The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam and the point of his spear \textit{weighed} six hundred iron shekels. \textit{His shield bearer} was walking in front of him.
\verse He stood and called to the battle lines of Israel and said to them, “Why have you come out to form ranks \textit{for} battle? \textit{Am} I not the Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Commission for yourselves a man and let him come down to me.
\verse If he \textit{is} able to fight with me and he defeats me, then we will be your servants; but if I prevail over him and defeat him, then you will be our servants and you will serve us.”
\verse Then the Philistine said, “I hereby defy the battle lines of Israel today! Give me a man so that we may fight each other!”
\verse When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and very afraid.
\verseWithHeading{David Enters the Scene of Battle} Now David was the son of an Ephrathite. This \textit{man was} from Bethlehem of Judah, and his name was Jesse. \textit{He had} eight sons; in the days of Saul this man was old, \textit{yet} he \textit{still} walked among the men.
\verse The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone and \textit{followed} Saul to the battle. The names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, his second \textit{oldest} was Abinadab, and the third was Shammah.
\verse Now David was the youngest. The three oldest \textit{followed} Saul,
\verse but David went \textit{back and forth} from Saul to feed the sheep of his father in Bethlehem.
\verse Now the Philistine came forward early and late, and he took his stand \textit{for} forty days.
\verse Then Jesse said to his son David, “Please take for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread, and bring \textit{them} quickly to the camp for your brothers.
\verse And these ten portions of cheese you will bring to the commander of the thousand; \textit{find out how your brothers are doing}, and take their pledge.”
\verse Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel \textit{were} in the valley of Elah fighting \textit{the} Philistines.
\verse David rose early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper, and he took \textit{the provisions} and went as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the encampment while the troops \textit{were} going to the battle line, and they raised the war cry.
\verse Israel and \textit{the} Philistines drew up \textit{in} battle lines, \textit{one battle line against the other}.
\verse David left the baggage \textit{he had} with him in the \textit{care} of the baggage keeper, ran to the battle line, and came and \textit{asked how his brothers were doing}.
\verse While he \textit{was} speaking to them, \textit{the champion}, whose name was Goliath the Philistine from Gath, \textit{was} coming up from the caves of \textit{the} Philistines. He spoke \textit{just as he had previously}, and David heard \textit{his words}.
\verse When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from his presence and were very afraid.
\verse And the men of Israel said, “Did you see this man who has come up? For he \textit{is} going up to defy Israel! It will be \textit{that} the man who defeats him, the king will make him very rich with great wealth and will give him his daughter \textit{in marriage} and will make his father’s house free in Israel.”
\verse Now David had spoken to the men \textit{who were} standing with him, saying, “What will be done for the man who defeats this Philistine and removes \textit{the} disgrace from Israel? For who \textit{is} this uncircumcised Philistine that he defies the battle lines of the living God?”
\verse And the troops had spoken to him according to this word, saying, “So it will be done for the man who defeats him.”
\verse His oldest brother Eliab heard while he was speaking to the men, \textit{and Eliab became very angry against David} and said, “Why have you come down today, and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumptuousness and the evil of your heart! For you have come down in order to see the battle!”
\verse David replied, “What have I done now? \textit{I merely asked a question}!
\verse He turned around from him to another opposite \textit{him} and \textit{he spoke to him in the same way}, and the people \textit{answered him as before}.
\verseWithHeading{David Appears before Saul} Now the words which David had spoken were heard and they reported \textit{them} \textit{to} Saul, and he summoned him.
\verse David said to Saul, “Do not let anyone’s heart fail concerning him! Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”
\verse But Saul said to David, “You will not be able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, because you are \textit{only} a boy, whereas \textit{he has} been a man of war since his childhood!”
\verse And David said to Saul, “Your servant has been a shepherd of the flock for his father. If the lion or the bear would come and carry off a sheep from the group,
\verse I would go out after it and strike it down and rescue \textit{the sheep} from its mouth. If it rose against me, I would grab \textit{it} by its beard and strike it down and kill it.
\verse Your servant has struck down both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he defied the battle lines of the living God.”
\verse And David said, “Adonai, who rescued me from the hand of the lion and from the hand of the bear, will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine!” Then Saul said to David, “Go and may Adonai be with you!”
\verse Then Saul clothed David with his \textit{own} fighting attire and put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him \textit{with} body armor.
\verse Then David strapped on his sword over his fighting attire, but he tried in vain to walk \textit{around}, for he was not trained to use \textit{them}. So David said to Saul, “I am not able to walk with these, because I am not trained to use \textit{them}.” So David removed them.
\verse Then he took his staff in his hand, picked out for himself five smooth stones from the wadi, and he put them in his shepherd’s bag, in the pouch. And with his sling in his hand, he approached the Philistine.
\verse Then the Philistine \textit{came on, getting nearer and nearer} to David, with \textit{his shield bearer} in front of him.
\verse When the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him, for he was \textit{only} a boy and ruddy with a handsome appearance.
\verse So the Philistine said to David, “\textit{Am} I a dog, that you \textit{are} coming to me with sticks?” Then the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
\verse The Philistine said to David, “Come to me so that I can give your flesh to the birds of heaven and to the wild animals of the field!”
\verse Then David said to the Philistine, “You \textit{are} coming to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I am coming to you in the name of Adonai of hosts, the God of the battle lines of Israel, whom you have defied!
\verse This day Adonai will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down \textit{and cut off your head}! Then I will give \textit{the} corpses of the army of \textit{the} Philistines this day to the birds of heaven and to the animals of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God \textit{who is} for Israel.
\verse And all of this assembly will know that Adonai does not rescue with sword or with spear, for the battle \textit{belongs} to Adonai, and he will give you into our hands!”
\verseWithHeading{David Defeats Goliath} \textit{When} the Philistine got up and came and drew near to meet David, David \textit{ran quickly} to the battle line to meet the Philistine.
\verse Then David put his hand into the bag and took a stone from it and slung \textit{it}. He struck the Philistine on his forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.
\verse So David prevailed over the Philistine with the sling and with the stone, and he struck down the Philistine and killed him, but there was no sword in David’s hand.
\verse Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it from its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
\verse The men of Israel and Judah got up, raised the war cry, and pursued \textit{the} Philistines \textit{as far as} the valley and up to the gates of Ekron. So the slain of \textit{the} Philistines fell on the way to Shaaraim up to Gath and as far as Ekron.
\verse Then the \textit{Israelites} returned from pursuing \textit{the} Philistines and plundered their camp.
\verse And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem and placed his weapons in his tent.
\verse Now when Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Whose son \textit{is} this young man, Abner?” And Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.”
\verse Then the king said, “You inquire whose son this young man \textit{is}.”
\verse So when David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul. The head of the Philistine \textit{was} in his hand.
\verse Then Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David said, “\textit{I am} the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”

\verseWithHeading{The Friendship of David and Jonathan} \textit{When} he finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan became attached to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his \textit{own} soul.
\verse Saul took him on that \textit{very} day and did not allow him to return to his father’s house.
\verse Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his \textit{own} soul.
\verse Jonathan stripped off the robe \textit{that he was wearing} and gave it to David, along with his fighting attire, and even his sword, his bow, and his belt.
\verseWithHeading{David’s Successes Arouse Saul’s Suspicions} David went out \textit{whenever} Saul sent him, \textit{and} he succeeded. So Saul appointed him over the men of the war, and it \textit{pleased} all the people and even \textit{pleased} the servants of Saul.
\verse \textit{When they were coming back} after David had returned from striking down the Philistine, the women went out from all the cities of Israel singing and dancing to meet King Saul with tambourines, with joy, and with three-stringed instruments.
\verse And the women sang as they danced, and they said,
\verse \textit{Saul became very angry}, and \textit{this saying displeased him}, and he thought, “They have attributed to David ten thousands, but to me they have attributed thousands! \textit{What more can he have but the kingdom}?”
\verse So Saul was watching David \textit{with suspicion} from that day onward.
\verse \textit{On} \textit{the} next day, the evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he prophesied in the middle of the house. Now David was playing \textit{the lyre} with his hand on \textit{that} day \textit{as usual}, and the spear was in Saul’s hand.
\verse Then Saul hurled the spear and thought, “\textit{I will pin David to the wall}.” But David eluded him twice.
\verse \textit{Now Saul was threatened by the presence of David} because Adonai was with him, but had departed from Saul.
\verse So Saul removed him \textit{from his presence}, and made him commander of a thousand, \textit{so he marched in and out at the front of the army}.
\verse And David was achieving success in all his ways and Adonai \textit{was} with him,
\verse but when Saul saw that he \textit{was} very successful, \textit{he was severely threatened by him}.
\verse However, all of Israel and Judah \textit{were} loving David, for he was going forth and marching ahead of them.
\verseWithHeading{David Marries Saul’s Daughter Michal} Then Saul said to David, “Here \textit{is} my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you as \textit{your} wife. Only be \textit{a brave warrior} for me and fight the battles of Adonai.” For Saul thought, “My hand will not be against him, but let the hand of \textit{the} Philistines be against him.”
\verse But David said to Saul, “Who \textit{am} I, and \textit{who are} my relatives, the clan of my father in Israel, that I should be a son-in-law to the king?”
\verse \textit{But} at the time Saul’s daughter Merab \textit{was} to be given to David, she was given \textit{instead} to Adriel the Meholathite as wife.
\verse Now Saul’s daughter Michal loved David, so they told Saul, and the matter \textit{pleased him}.
\verse And Saul thought, “I will give her to him, so that she may be a snare for him and the hand of \textit{the} Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David, “For a second \textit{time} you can become my son-in-law today.”
\verse Then Saul commanded his servants, “Speak to David in secret, saying, ‘Look, the king \textit{is} pleased with you, and all his servants love you. So then, become a son-in-law of the king.’ ”
\verse And Saul’s servants spoke these words \textit{to David privately}. But David said, “\textit{Is} it insignificant \textit{in your sight} to become the son-in-law of the king, \textit{as} I am a poor and lightly esteemed man?”
\verse So the servants of Saul informed him, saying, “\textit{This is what David said}.”
\verse Then Saul said, “This \textit{is} what you must say to David: ‘\textit{The king desires no bride price} except for a hundred foreskins of \textit{the} Philistines, to avenge himself on the enemies of the king.’ ” (Now Saul had planned to allow David to fall by the hand of \textit{the} Philistines.)
\verse So his servants told David these words, and the matter \textit{pleased David} to become the son-in-law of the king \textit{as} \textit{the specified time had not expired}.
\verse And David got up, and he and his men went and struck down two hundred men \textit{of the} Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and \textit{they presented the full number} to become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as \textit{his} wife.
\verse When Saul \textit{realized} that Adonai \textit{was} with David and \textit{his own daughter Michal} loved him,
\verse Saul \textit{was threatened by David still more}, so Saul \textit{became a perpetual enemy of David}.

\verseWithHeading{Jonathan Intercedes for David} Now Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants about killing David, but Saul’s son Jonathan \textit{liked David very much}.
\verse So Jonathan informed David, saying, “My father Saul \textit{is} trying to kill you; now please take care! In the morning you should stay in the hiding place and conceal yourself.
\verse I will go out and stand \textit{at my father’s side} in the field where you are, and I will speak about you to my father; \textit{if I find out anything} I will tell \textit{it} to you.”
\verse So Jonathan spoke well about David to his father Saul and said to him, “The king should not sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his service for you \textit{has been} very good.
\verse He put his life in his hand and attacked the Philistine, and Adonai brought about a great victory for all of Israel, and you saw \textit{it} and rejoiced! Now why should you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause?”
\verse And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan and swore, “\textit{As Adonai lives}, he will not be put to death!”
\verse Jonathan called to David and told him all of these words. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul and he was before him as \textit{formerly}.
\verseWithHeading{David Has to Flee Again} War came again, so David went out and fought against \textit{the} Philistines and \textit{defeated them thoroughly} so that they fled before him.
\verse Then the evil spirit from Adonai came upon Saul while he was sitting in his house \textit{with} his spear in his hand. And David \textit{was} playing a stringed instrument in \textit{his} hand.
\verse So Saul tried \textit{to pin David to the wall with the spear}, but \textit{he eluded Saul}, so that he struck the spear into the wall, and David fled and escaped that \textit{same} night.
\verse Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house to guard him and to kill him in the morning, but Michal his wife told David, saying, “If \textit{you do not save your life} tonight, \textit{then} tomorrow you \textit{will be} killed!”
\verse So Michal lowered David through the window, and he went and fled and escaped.
\verse Then Michal took the household god and put it on the bed and put a quilt of goat’s hair at its head and covered \textit{it} with the clothes.
\verse And Saul sent messengers to arrest David, but she said, “He \textit{is} ill.”
\verse So Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, so that I can kill him.”
\verse When the messengers came, \textit{to their surprise} the idol \textit{was} on the bed \textit{with} the quilt of goat’s hair at the head.
\verse Then Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this and sent away my enemy, so that he escaped?” Michal said to Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go, why should I kill you?’ ”
\verse So David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth.
\verse And it was told to Saul, “David \textit{is} in Naioth in Ramah.”
\verse So Saul sent messengers to capture David. When they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and Samuel standing \textit{as} chief over them, then the Spirit of God came upon Saul’s messengers, and they also prophesied.
\verse So they told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Again Saul sent messengers a third \textit{time}, and they also prophesied.
\verse Then he also went to Ramah. When he came to the great cistern which \textit{was} in Secu, he asked and said, “Where \textit{are} Samuel and David?” Someone said, “Look \textit{they are} in Naioth in Ramah.”
\verse So he went there to Naioth in Ramah and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and \textit{he walked along prophesying} until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
\verse He also stripped \textit{off} his clothes and prophesied before Samuel. He lay naked all that day and all night. Therefore they say, “\textit{Is} Saul also among the prophets?”

\verseWithHeading{Jonathan Supports David over Saul} Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said before Jonathan, “What have I done? What \textit{is} my guilt and what \textit{is} my sin before your father that \textit{he is} \textit{trying to kill me}?
\verse And he said to him, “Far from it! You will not die! Look, my father does not do \textit{anything large or small unless he reveals it to me}. Why should my father hide this thing or anything from me?”
\verse Then David \textit{took an oath} again and said, “Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he thought, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he worry.’ But \textit{as Adonai lives} and \textit{as your soul lives}, surely \textit{there is} merely a step between me and death!”
\verse Then Jonathan said to David, “\textit{Whatever you wish}, I will do for you.”
\verse David said to Jonathan, “Look, tomorrow \textit{is} the new moon, and I should certainly sit with the king to eat. You must send me away so that I can hide myself in the field until the third evening.
\verse If your father misses me at all, then you must say, ‘David earnestly asked from me to run to Bethlehem his city, for \textit{the yearly sacrifice} \textit{is} there for all the clan.’
\verse If he says ‘Good,’ \textit{it will mean} peace for your servant; but if he \textit{is} very angry, know that \textit{he has decided to do me harm}.
\verse So you must show loyal love to your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of Adonai with you. But if there \textit{is} guilt in me, \textit{then} kill me yourself! But why should you bring me to your father?”
\verse Then Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! For if I know for certain that \textit{my father decided evil should come upon you}, would I not have told it to you?”
\verse Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if what your father answers you \textit{is} harsh?”
\verse And Jonathan said to David, “Come, let us go out to the field.” So the two of them went out to the field.
\verse Then Jonathan said to David, “Adonai the God of Israel \textit{is my witness} that I will question my father \textit{by this time the day after tomorrow}. And look, \textit{if he is well disposed toward you}, will I not send \textit{word} to you and \textit{disclose it to you}?
\verse \textit{So may Adonai punish Jonathan and more} if \textit{my father decides to do you harm} and if \textit{I fail to disclose it to you} and send word to you that you can go safely. And may Adonai be with you, as he has been with my father.
\verse And not while I am still alive, will you not show the loyal love of Adonai with me, that I may not die?
\verse And do not cut off your loyal love from \textit{my family} forever, not \textit{even} when Adonai \textit{exterminates} each of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.”
\verse So Jonathan \textit{made a covenant} with the house of David, \textit{saying,} “May Adonai \textit{call the enemies of David to account}.”
\verse And Jonathan again made David swear an oath, because he loved him; for with the love of his soul he loved him.
\verse Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow \textit{is} the new moon, and you will be missed, for your seat will stay empty.
\verse On the third day you must go down quickly and go to the place where you hid yourself \textit{on the day all this started} and remain beside the stone Ezel.
\verse I will shoot three arrows \textit{to the} side as \textit{if} I were shooting at a target.
\verse \textit{Then} I will send \textit{word to} my servant, ‘Go, find the arrows!’ If I clearly say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows \textit{are} \textit{on this side of you}; \textit{bring} it,’ then come, for \textit{it means} peace for you. And there is no problem, \textit{as Adonai lives}.
\verse But if I say this to the young man, ‘Look, the arrows \textit{are} \textit{beyond you},’ go, for Adonai has sent you away.
\verse And \textit{as for} the matter about which you and I spoke, look, Adonai \textit{is} between you and me forever.”
\verse So David hid himself in the field. \textit{When the new moon came}, \textit{the king was seated at the feast}.
\verse The king sat at his seat \textit{as before}, the seat by the wall, and Jonathan got up, and Abner sat beside Saul, but David’s place was empty.
\verse But Saul said nothing on that day, for he thought, “\textit{Something happened to him}. He \textit{is} not \textit{ceremonially} clean; surely he \textit{is} not clean.”
\verse \textit{And then} on the next day, the second day of the new moon, that David’s place was empty. So Saul asked Jonathan his son, “Why did the son of Jesse not come either yesterday or today to the feast?”
\verse Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked permission from me \textit{to go} up to Bethlehem.
\verse He said, ‘Send me away, please, for our clan sacrifice \textit{is} in the city, and my brother commanded me \textit{to be present}. So then, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me slip away and see my brothers.’ Therefore he has not come to the table of the king.”
\verse Then \textit{Saul became angry} at Jonathan and said to him, “\textit{You} son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?
\verse For \textit{as long as} the son of Jesse \textit{is} alive on the earth, you and your kingdom will not be established! So then, send and bring him to me, for \textit{he will surely die}!”
\verse But Jonathan answered his father Saul and said to him, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”
\verse Then Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. So Jonathan knew \textit{that his father had decided} to kill David.
\verse Jonathan got up from the table \textit{enraged}, and did not eat on the second day of the new moon because he was upset about David, because his father had disgraced him.
\verse \textit{And then} in the morning Jonathan went out to the field for the appointment with David, and a young boy \textit{was} with him.
\verse He said to his servant, “Run, please find the arrows that I am shooting!” The boy ran, and he shot the arrow to pass \textit{over} him.
\verse When the boy came up to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called out after the boy and said, “\textit{Is} not the arrow \textit{beyond you}?”
\verse Then Jonathan called out after the boy, “Quick, hurry, do not linger!” And Jonathan’s servant collected the arrows and came to his master.
\verse But the boy did not know anything \textit{about this}; only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
\verse Jonathan gave his weapons to his servant and said to him, “Go, bring \textit{them} to the city.”
\verse The boy left, and then David got up from the south side, and he fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. And they kissed \textit{each other} and wept \textit{together}, but David \textit{wept} the most.
\verse Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, because we have sworn, the two of us, \textit{an oath} in the name of Adonai, saying, “Adonai will be between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring forever.” Then he got up and left, and Jonathan went into the city.

\verseWithHeading{David Encounters the Priests of Nob} Now David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech came trembling to meet David, and he said to him, “Why are you alone and there are no men with you?”
\verse So David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king charged me \textit{with} a matter and said to me, ‘No one must know anything about this matter \textit{on} which I am sending you, \textit{with} which I have charged you and the servants.’ ” So \textit{I have arranged to meet with my servants at a certain place}.
\verse Now then, \textit{what do you have at hand}? Give me five \textit{loaves} of bread or \textit{whatever is here}.”
\verse The priest answered David and said, “There is no ordinary bread \textit{here at hand}; there is only holy bread, \textit{but} only if the young men have kept themselves from women.”
\verse David answered the priest and said to him, “Indeed, women \textit{were} held back from us \textit{as it has been when I’ve gone out before}. And the things of the young men are holy when it \textit{is} an ordinary journey. \textit{How much more} \textit{today} will the things be holy?”
\verse So the priest gave him \textit{the} holy \textit{bread}, for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence, which was removed from before Adonai, in order to set hot bread \textit{there} on the day when it was taken away.
\verse Now there was a man from the servants of Saul on that day, detained before Adonai, whose name \textit{was} Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul’s shepherds.
\verse David asked Ahimelech, “Is there not \textit{at your disposal} a spear or a sword? For I took neither my sword nor my weapons with me because the king’s matter was urgent.”
\verse So the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine whom you killed in the valley of Elah \textit{is} here, wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want to take it for yourself, \textit{then} take it, for there is no other except it here.” And David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”
\verseWithHeading{David Flees to Achish in Gath} So David got up and fled on that day from the presence of Saul, and he came to Achish the king of Gath.
\verse The servants of Achish said to him, “\textit{Is} not this David the king of the land? \textit{Is} it not for this \textit{one} that they sang in the dances, saying, ‘Saul killed his thousands, but David his ten thousands?’ ”
\verse \textit{David took these words seriously} and \textit{felt severely threatened by} Achish the king of Gath.
\verse So he changed his behavior \textit{before them} and pretended to be mad \textit{in their presence}. He made scratches on the doors of the gate and let his saliva run down into his beard.
\verse Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see a madman! Why did you bring him to me?
\verse Do I lack madmen that you have brought this one to act like a madman before me? Should this one enter my household?”

\begin{biblechapter} % 1 Samuel 22
\verseWithHeading{Saul Takes Revenge on the Priests Who Helped David} David went from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s household heard, they came down to him there.
\verse Every man in distress and every man who had a creditor and every embittered man gathered to him, and he became \textit{their commander}. Now there \textit{were} about four hundred men with him.
\verse And David went up from there to Mizpah of Moab. He said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother \textit{stay} with you until I know what God will do for me.”
\verse So \textit{he brought them before the king of Moab}, and they stayed with him all the days David was in the stronghold.
\verse Then Gad the prophet said to David, “You should not stay in the stronghold; leave and go into the land of Judah.” So David left and came \textit{to} the forest of Hereth.
\verse Now Saul heard that David and the men who \textit{were} with him had been located. Saul \textit{was} sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk \textit{tree} at Ramah. Now his spear \textit{was} in his hand and all his servants \textit{were} stationed around him.
\verse Then Saul said to the servants who \textit{were} standing around him, “Please listen, \textit{Benjaminites}! Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?
\verse For all of you have conspired against me, and \textit{no one discloses to me} the \textit{making} \textit{of an agreement} between my son and the son of Jesse! None of you have had sympathy for me or \textit{disclosed to me} \textit{that} \textit{my son commissioned my servant against me to ambush me} as \textit{has been done} this day!”
\verse But Doeg the Edomite, who \textit{was} stationed among the servants of Saul, answered and said, “I saw the son of Jesse going to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
\verse And he inquired of Adonai for him and gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”
\verse So the king sent to summon Ahimelech the son of Ahitub the priest, and all his father’s household, the priests who \textit{were} at Nob. So all of them came to the king.
\verse Saul said, “Listen please, son of Ahitub.” He said, “Here I \textit{am}, my lord.”
\verse Then Saul said to him, “Why did you conspire against me, you and the son of Jesse, when you gave to him bread and a sword, and by inquiring of God for him so that he might arise against me to ambush \textit{me} as \textit{has been done} this day?”
\verse But Ahimelech answered the king and said, “And who among all your servants \textit{is} as faithful as David? He \textit{is} the son-in-law of the king who moves \textit{quickly} to safeguard you and is honored in your house.
\verse \textit{Only} today I began to inquire of God for him. Far be it from me that \textit{the king should impute anything against his servant} or against my father’s household, for your servant has not known any of this matter, little or much.”
\verse Then the king said, “You must certainly die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s household!”
\verse So the king said to the runners \textit{who were} stationed around him, “Turn and kill the priests of Adonai, because \textit{they also support David} and because they knew that he was fleeing and \textit{did not disclose it to me}.” But the servants of the king \textit{were} not willing to raise their hand to attack the priests of Adonai.
\verse Then the king said to Doeg, “You turn and attack the priests!” So Doeg the Edomite turned and attacked the priests himself, and on that day he killed eighty-five men who wore \textit{the} linen ephod.
\verse And \textit{he put to the sword} Nob, the city of the priests, from man to woman, from child to infant, and ox and donkey and sheep; \textit{all} \textit{to the sword}.
\verse But, one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, whose name was Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.
\verse Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of Adonai.
\verse Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew on that day that Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would certainly tell Saul. \textit{I am responsible for the deaths of all your father’s household}!
\verse Stay with me! Do not fear, because he who seeks my life seeks your life. You are in good care with me.”

\verseWithHeading{David Defeats the Philistines at Keilah} Now they told David, “Look, \textit{the} Philistines \textit{are} fighting in Keilah and they \textit{are} raiding the threshing floors.”
\verse So David inquired of Adonai, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?” And Adonai said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah.”
\verse But David’s men said to him, “Look, we \textit{are} afraid here in Judah. \textit{How much more} \textit{if} we go \textit{to} Keilah to the battle lines of \textit{the} Philistines?”
\verse So David again inquired of Adonai, and Adonai answered him and said, “Get up, go down \textit{to} Keilah, for I \textit{am} giving \textit{the} Philistines into your hand.”
\verse So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with \textit{the} Philistines. They drove off their livestock and \textit{dealt them a heavy blow}. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
\verseWithHeading{David Flees from Saul at Keilah} \textit{Now when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled} to David \textit{at} Keilah, he went down \textit{with} an ephod in his hand.
\verse When it was told to Saul that David had gone to Keilah, Saul said, “God \textit{has given him} into my hand, because he has shut himself in by going into a city \textit{with} \textit{two barred gates}.
\verse Saul then summoned all of the army for the battle, to go down \textit{to} Keilah to lay a siege against David and his men.
\verse When David learned that Saul \textit{was} plotting evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.”
\verse And David said, “O Adonai, God of Israel, your servant has clearly heard that Saul \textit{is} seeking to come to Keilah to destroy the city because of me.
\verse Will the rulers of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? O Adonai, God of Israel, please tell your servant!” And Adonai said, “He will come down.”
\verse Then David said, “Will the rulers of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?” And Adonai said, “They will deliver \textit{you}.”
\verse So David and his men got up, about six hundred men, and went out from Keilah and wandered wherever they could go. When it was told to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, \textit{he stopped his pursuit}.
\verseWithHeading{David Eludes Saul’s Pursuit} David remained in the wilderness, in the strongholds, and in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him \textit{continually}, but God did not give him into his hand.
\verse When David realized that Saul had gone out to seek his life, David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.
\verse So Jonathan the son of Saul got up and went to David \textit{at} Horesh, and \textit{encouraged him} through God.
\verse He said to him, “Do not be afraid, for the hand of my father Saul will not find you. You will be king over Israel, and \textit{I will be second to you}. My father Saul knows \textit{this} also.”
\verse Then the two of them \textit{made} a covenant before Adonai. David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went to his house.
\verse Then \textit{the} Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “\textit{Is} not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh on the hill of Hakilah, which \textit{is} south of Jeshimon?
\verse So then, O king, \textit{whenever you want} to come down, come down, and \textit{it will be} for us to deliver him into the hand of the king.”
\verse And Saul said to them, “May you be blessed by Adonai, for you have shown me compassion!
\verse Go, please, make certain again! Find out and see \textit{exactly where he is} and who has seen him there! For they have said to me, ‘He \textit{is} very cunning.’
\verse Look, find out all of the hiding places where he hides. Then return to me \textit{with dependable information}, and I will go with you. And then if he \textit{is} there in the land, then I will seek him among all the thousands of Judah.”
\verse Then they got up and went to Ziph before Saul.
\verse Now David and his men \textit{were} in the wilderness of Maon in the Arabah, to the south of Jeshimon.
\verse And Saul and his men went to seek \textit{him}, and they told David, so he went down \textit{to} the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard \textit{this}, he pursued David \textit{into} the wilderness of Maon.
\verse Saul went \textit{on one side of the mountain}, and David and his men \textit{went on the other side of the mountain}. David was hurrying to get away from Saul, while Saul and his men \textit{were} closing in on David and his men to capture them.
\verse But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, because \textit{the} Philistines have made a raid on the land!”
\verse So Saul returned from pursuing David, and he went to confront \textit{the} Philistines. Therefore, they called that place the Rock of Division.

\verseWithHeading{David Spares Saul in the Cave at En Gedi} When Saul returned from \textit{pursuing the} Philistines, they told him, “Look, David \textit{is} in the wilderness of En Gedi.”
\verse So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel, and he and his men went to search \textit{for} David \textit{in the direction of} the Rocks of the Mountain Goats.
\verse He came to the sheep pens beside the road, and a cave \textit{was} there. Then Saul went in \textit{to relieve himself}. Now David and his men \textit{were} sitting in the innermost part of the cave.
\verse And David’s men said to him, “Look, today \textit{is} the day about which Adonai said to you, ‘See, I am giving your enemy into your hand, and you can do to him \textit{whatever seems good to you}.’ ” So David got up and secretly cut the hem of Saul’s robe.
\verse \textit{And then} afterward David \textit{felt guilty}, because he had cut \textit{the hem of Saul’s robe}.
\verse He said to his men, “Far be it from me in Adonai, that I do this thing to my lord, to Adonai’s anointed one, by stretching out my hand against him! For he \textit{is} the anointed one of Adonai.”
\verse So David rebuked his men with the words and did not allow them to rise against Saul. And Saul got up from the cave, and he went on his way.
\verse Then David got up afterward and went out of the cave and called after Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked after him, David knelt down \textit{with his} face to the ground and bowed down.
\verse Then David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of people who say: ‘Look, David \textit{is} \textit{seeking to do you harm}’?
\verse Look, this day your eyes have seen that Adonai gave you today into my hand in the cave, and some said to kill you. But \textit{I took pity} on you and said, ‘I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, because he \textit{is} Adonai’s anointed one.’
\verse Now, my father, see, yes, see, the hem of your robe in my hand! For \textit{when I cut} the hem of your robe I did not kill you. Know and \textit{realize} that there is no evil or rebellion in my hand. I did not sin against you, but you \textit{are} hunting down my life to take it.
\verse May Adonai judge between me and you, and may Adonai avenge me on you, but my hand will not be against you!
\verse Just as the ancient proverb says, ‘From the wicked, wickedness goes out,’ but my hand will not be against you!
\verse After whom did the king of Israel go out? After whom are you pursuing? After a dead dog? After one flea?
\verse May Adonai be \textit{the} judge, and let him judge between me and you, and may he see and plead my case. \textit{May he vindicate me against you}!”
\verse When David finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “\textit{Is} this your voice, my son David?” And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.
\verse Then he said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me the good, but I have repaid you the evil.
\verse You have explained to me today that you have dealt well with me, how Adonai delivered me into your hand but you did not kill me.
\verse For a man has found his enemy but sent him on \textit{his} way safely. Now may Adonai reward you with good in return for this day, for what you have done for me.
\verse So now then, look, I know that you will certainly be king and the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.
\verse So then, swear to me by Adonai that you will not cut off my \textit{descendants} after me and that you will not wipe out my name from my father’s house.”

\verseWithHeading{Samuel’s Death} Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him. They buried him at his house at Ramah. Then David got up and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
\verseWithHeading{David and Abigail} Now there was a man in Maon, whose business \textit{was} in Carmel. The man was very rich and \textit{owned} three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. \textit{Now} the shearing of his sheep \textit{was taking place} in Carmel.
\verse The name of the man \textit{was} Nabal, and the name of his wife \textit{was} Abigail. Now the woman \textit{was} wise and beautiful, but the man \textit{was} stubborn and \textit{mean}, and he \textit{was} as his heart.
\verse David heard in the wilderness that Nabal \textit{was} shearing his sheep.
\verse So David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel and go to Nabal; \textit{you will greet him in my name}.
\verse Then you must say to him, ‘\textit{Long} life \textit{to you}, and \textit{may it go well with you, with your house, and with all that is yours}.
\verse Now I have heard that \textit{you have shearers}. Now while your shepherds \textit{were} with us, we did not mistreat them, and nothing of theirs \textit{was} missing, all the days they were in Carmel.
\verse Ask your servants and they will tell you! Let the young men find favor in your eyes because we have come on a feast day. Please give \textit{whatever you have on hand} for your servants and for your son David.”
\verse So David’s young men came and they spoke all these words to Nabal in the name of David. Then they waited.
\verse But Nabal answered David’s servants and said, “Who \textit{is} David? And who \textit{is} the son of Jesse? Today, \textit{there} are many servants breaking away from the presence of their masters.
\verse Should I take my bread and my water and my meat which I have slaughtered for my shearers and give \textit{it} to men whom I do not know where they \textit{are} from?
\verse So David’s young men turned on their way and returned and came and told him according to all these words.
\verse Then David said to his men, “Each man strap on his sword!” So each one strapped on his sword, and David also strapped on his sword. About four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred remained with the baggage.
\verse But a young man of the servants told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Look, David sent messengers from the desert to greet our master, but he addressed them angrily,
\verse even though the men \textit{were} very good to us; we were not mistreated and did not miss anything all the days we went about with them \textit{while we were} in the field.
\verse They were a wall to us both night and day, all \textit{the days we were} with them keeping the sheep.
\verse And so then, know and \textit{consider} what you should do, for evil has been decided against our master and against all his household, and he \textit{is such} \textit{a wicked man}, \textit{nobody can reason with him}!”
\verse Then Abigail \textit{quickly took} two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five prepared sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred raisin cakes, and two hundred fig cakes, and she put \textit{them} on the donkeys.
\verse Then she said to her servants, “Go ahead before me; look, I am coming after you,” but she did not tell her husband Nabal.
\verse \textit{And then}, \textit{as} she \textit{was} riding on the donkey and \textit{was} going down the ravine of the mountain, David and his men \textit{were} coming down to meet her, and she met them.
\verse Now David had said, “Surely \textit{in vain} I guarded all that this fellow had in the desert. And nothing was missed of all that \textit{was} his, but he returned evil against me in place of good!
\verse \textit{May God severely punish the enemies of David} and again do thus if I leave behind \textit{anything that is his} until the morning, \textit{not even} \textit{one male}!”
\verse When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got down from the donkey and fell on her face before \textit{David’s anger}, and she bowed down to the ground.
\verse She fell at his feet and said, “On me, my lord, \textit{be} the guilt! Please let your female servant speak \textit{to you personally}! Hear the words of your female servant!
\verse Please do not let my lord set his heart against \textit{this worthless man}, Nabal; for as his name, so \textit{is} he. Nabal \textit{is} his name, and stupidity \textit{is} with him! But I, your female servant, did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent.
\verse So then, my lord, \textit{as Adonai lives and as your soul lives}, since Adonai restrained you from bloodguilt \textit{by taking matters into your own hand}, so then, may your enemies be like Nabal, even \textit{those who seek to do my lord harm}.
\verse So then, this gift which your female servant has brought to my lord, may it be given to the young men \textit{who follow my lord}.
\verse Please forgive the transgression of your female servant, because Adonai will certainly make a lasting house for my lord, because my lord \textit{is} fighting the battles of Adonai, and evil will not be found in you \textit{as long as you live}.
\verse Should a man arise to pursue you and to seek your life, may the life of my lord be wrapped in the pouch of the living with Adonai your God. But as for the life of your enemy, he will sling it from within the pocket of the sling!
\verse \textit{And then} when Adonai has done for my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you as leader over Israel,
\verse then this will not be an obstacle for you or a stumbling block of conscience for my lord \textit{either} by the shedding of blood without cause or by \textit{my lord taking matters into his own hands}. And when Adonai does good to my lord, then remember your female servant.”
\verse Then David said to Abigail, “Blessed be Adonai the God of Israel who has sent you this day to meet me!
\verse And blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you who have prevented me this day from bloodguilt and \textit{from} delivering myself by my own hand.
\verse But \textit{as Adonai lives}, the God of Israel who has prevented me from harming you, if you had not hurried and come to meet me, surely there would not have been \textit{one male} left alive for Nabal by the light of morning!”
\verse Then David took from her hand what she had brought for him, and he said to her, “Go up to your house in peace. See, I have listened to your voice, and I have \textit{granted your request}.”
\verse Then Abigail went to Nabal, and look, \textit{he was holding a feast} in his house like the feast of the king. \textit{Nabal was enjoying himself}, and he \textit{was} very drunk, so she did not tell him a thing, \textit{nothing at all}, until the light of morning.
\verse \textit{And then} in the morning when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these words. Then his heart died \textit{within him}, and he became like a stone.
\verse \textit{And then}, about ten days later, Adonai struck Nabal and he died.
\verse When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, “Blessed be Adonai who has vindicated the case of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and he has kept back his servant from evil; but Adonai has returned the evil of Nabal on his \textit{own} head.” Then David sent and spoke with Abigail to take her for his wife.
\verse So the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, and they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us to you to take you for his wife.”
\verse She got up and bowed down \textit{with} her face to the ground and said, “Here is your female servant, as a slave to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.”
\verse Then Abigail \textit{quickly got up} and rode on the donkey, \textit{along with} five of her maidservants who \textit{attended her}, and she went after the messengers of David and became his wife.
\verse David had also taken Ahinoam from Jezreel, and both of them became his wives.

\verseWithHeading{David Again Spares Saul} The Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “\textit{Is} not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah opposite Jeshimon?”
\verse Then Saul got up and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
\verse Now Saul was on the hill of Hakilah, which \textit{is} opposite Jeshimon by the road, but David was staying in the wilderness. When he realized that Saul had come to the wilderness after him,
\verse David sent spies, and he learned that Saul had come \textit{for certain}.
\verse Then David got up and came to the place where Saul had encamped, and David saw the place where Saul \textit{was} lying down, \textit{as well as} Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. (Now Saul \textit{was} lying in the encampment, and the army \textit{was} encamping around him.)
\verse David answered and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah the brother of Joab, saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul, in the camp?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”
\verse So David and Abishai came to the army \textit{by} night, and \textit{there was} Saul lying asleep in the encampment with his spear thrust into the ground near his head, and Abner and the army \textit{were} lying all around him.
\verse Then Abishai said to David, “God has handed over your enemy into your hand today! So then, \textit{please let me pin him to the ground with the spear} \textit{one time}, and \textit{I will not strike him twice}.”
\verse But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him! For who has stretched out his hand against Adonai’s anointed one and remained blameless?”
\verse And David said, “\textit{As Adonai lives}, \textit{certainly} Adonai will strike him, or his day will come and he will die, or he will go down in the battle and \textit{perish}.
\verse \textit{Adonai forbid me} from stretching out my hand against Adonai’s anointed one! So then, please take the spear that \textit{is} near his head and the jar of water, and let us go.”
\verse So David took the spear and the jar of water from \textit{near} Saul’s head, and they went \textit{away}. \textit{No one saw, no one knew, and no one awakened}, for all of them \textit{were} sleeping because a deep sleep of Adonai had fallen upon them.
\verse Then David went to the other side and stood on the top of the hill at a distance; the distance \textit{was} great between them.
\verse David called out to the army and to Abner the son of Ner, “Will you not answer, Abner?” And Abner answered and said, “Who \textit{are} you \textit{that} you call to the king?”
\verse So David said to Abner, “\textit{Are} you not a man? And who \textit{is} like you in Israel? Why did you not keep watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came to destroy your lord the king.
\verse This thing that you have done \textit{is} not good. \textit{As Adonai lives}, \textit{surely you people deserve to die} since you have not kept watch over your lord, over Adonai’s anointed one! So then, see where the king’s spear \textit{is} and the jar of water that \textit{was} near his head!”
\verse Then Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “\textit{Is} this your voice, my son David?” And David said, “\textit{It is} my voice, my lord the king.”
\verse Then he said, “Why \textit{is} my lord pursuing after his servant? For what have I done? And what evil \textit{is} in my hand?
\verse And so then, please let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant: If Adonai has incited you against me, may he delight in an offering; but if \textit{it is mortals}, \textit{may} they be accursed \textit{before} Adonai, for they have driven me away today from sharing in the inheritance of Adonai, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods!’
\verse And so then, do not let my blood fall to the ground \textit{away from} the presence of Adonai, for the king of Israel has gone out to seek a single flea, as one hunts a partridge in the mountains.”
\verse Then Saul said, “I have sinned! Come back, David my son, for I will not harm you again, because my life \textit{was} precious in your eyes this day. Look, I have acted like a fool and \textit{have made a terrible mistake}.”
\verse David answered and said, “Here is the king’s spear; let one of the young men come over and take it.
\verse Adonai repays to each \textit{one} his righteousness and his faithfulness, for Adonai gave you into my hand today, but I was not willing to stretch out my hand against Adonai’s anointed.
\verse Look, as your life was precious in my eyes this day, may my life be great in the eyes of Adonai, and may he rescue me from all trouble.”
\verse Then Saul said to David, “Blessed are you, my son David; \textit{you will not only do many things, but also will always succeed}!” Then David went on his way and Saul returned to his place.

\begin{biblechapter} % 1 Samuel 27
\verseWithHeading{David Returns to Achish} Then David \textit{thought to himself}, “Now I will perish one day by the hand of Saul! There is nothing better for me but \textit{that} I must certainly escape to the land of \textit{the} Philistines. Then Saul will desist from searching for me further in all of the territories of Israel, and so I will escape from his hand.”
\verse So David got up and crossed over, he and the six hundred men who \textit{were} with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, the king of Gath.
\verse David settled with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each with his household. David \textit{took along} his two wives Ahinoam \textit{from Jezreel} and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
\verse And it was reported to Saul that David had fled \textit{to} Gath, so \textit{he no longer searched for him}.
\verse Then David said to Achish, “Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, then let them give me a place in one of the \textit{country towns} that I can live there. Why should your servant live in \textit{the royal city} with you?”
\verse So Achish gave him Ziklag on that day. (Therefore, Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah until this day.)
\verse The number of days that David lived in the countryside of the Philistines \textit{was} one year and four months.
\verse Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites and the Girzites and the Amalekites, for they had been living \textit{in} the land for a long time \textit{in the direction of} Shur and \textit{as far as} the land of Egypt.
\verse So David struck the land and did not leave a man or a woman alive; he took the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing. Then he returned and came to Achish.
\verse And Achish said, “Against whom have you raided today?” David said, “Against the Negev of Judah and against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites and against the Negev of the Kenites.”
\verse And David did not leave alive a man or a woman to bring \textit{them back} to Gath, thinking, “So that they will not report about us, saying, ‘David did thus and so.’ ” Thus was his practice all the days that he lived in the countryside of \textit{the} Philistines.
\verse And Achish trusted David, saying, “\textit{He has made himself utterly hated} among his people in Israel, and he will be my servant forever.”

\verse \textit{Now} in those days \textit{the} Philistines gathered their forces for war to fight against Israel. So Achish said to David, “Certainly you realize that you must go out with me in the army, you and your men.”
\verse David said to Achish, “Very well, you will know what your servant can do.” Achish said to David, “Very well, I will make you \textit{my bodyguard} for life.”
\verseWithHeading{Saul Inquires of the Medium at Endor} (Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him, and they had buried him in Ramah, his \textit{own} city. And Saul had expelled the mediums and the soothsayers from the land.)
\verse Then \textit{the} Philistines assembled and came and encamped at Shunem, so Saul assembled all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa.
\verse When Saul saw the army of \textit{the} Philistines, he was afraid and his heart trembled greatly.
\verse And Saul inquired of Adonai, but Adonai did not answer him, not by dreams or by the Urim or by the prophets.
\verse So Saul said to his servants, “Search for me \textit{a woman who is a medium} so that I may go to her and inquire of her.” His servants said to him, “Look \textit{there is} a woman who \textit{is} a medium in Endor.”
\verse So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes, and he went \textit{with two of his men}. And they came to the woman \textit{by} night and he said, “Please consult a spirit for me through \textit{the ritual pit}, and bring up for me \textit{the one} whom I tell you.”
\verse But the woman said to him, “Look, you know what Saul did, how he exterminated the mediums and the soothsayers from the land! Why \textit{are} you setting a trap for my life to kill me?”
\verse Then Saul swore to her by Adonai, “\textit{As Adonai lives}, \textit{you will not be punished} for this thing.”
\verse So the woman asked, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” He said, “Bring up Samuel for me.”
\verse When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice, and the woman said to Saul, “Why did you deceive me? You \textit{are} Saul!”
\verse The king said to her, “Do not be afraid! What do you see?” And the woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up from the ground!”
\verse Then he said to her, “What \textit{is} his appearance?” She said, “An old man \textit{is} coming up, and \textit{he is wrapped in a robe}.” Then Saul realized that it was Samuel, and he knelt \textit{with} his face to the ground and bowed down.
\verse Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” And Saul said, “\textit{I am in distress}! For \textit{the} Philistines \textit{are about} to make war against me, but God has turned away from me, and he does not answer me any more, not \textit{by the prophets} or by the dreams. So I called to you to let me know what I should do.”
\verse Then Samuel said, “Why do you ask me, since Adonai has turned away from you and has become your enemy?
\verse Adonai has done to you just as he spoke by my hand! Adonai has torn the kingdom from your hand and has given it to your neighbor, to David.
\verse Because you \textit{did not obey} Adonai and did not carry out the fierce anger of his \textit{wrath} against Amalek, therefore Adonai has done this thing to you today.
\verse And Adonai will also give Israel with you into the hands of \textit{the} Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons \textit{will be} with me, and Adonai will also give the army of Israel into \textit{the} hand of \textit{the} Philistines.”
\verse \textit{Then Saul immediately fell prostrate} to the ground, and he was very afraid because of the words of Samuel; there was no more strength in him, for he had not eaten food all day and all night.
\verse Then the woman came to Saul and realized that he was absolutely terrified, so she said to him, “Look, your female servant \textit{has obeyed you}, and I have \textit{risked my life}. I have listened to your words that you have spoken to me.
\verse So then, you also please listen to the voice of your female servant, and let me set before you a morsel of bread, and \textit{you} eat so that \textit{you will have strength} in you when you go on your way.”
\verse But he refused and said, “I will not eat!” However, his servants urged him, and the woman also. So he listened \textit{to what they said}, and he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.
\verse Now the woman had a fattened bull calf in the house, \textit{so she quickly slaughtered it} and took flour, kneaded \textit{dough}, and baked him \textit{some} unleavened bread.
\verse She brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they got up and went away that \textit{very} night.

\verse Then the commanders of \textit{the} Philistines said, “What \textit{are} these Hebrews \textit{doing here}?” And Achish said to the commanders of \textit{the} Philistines, “Is this not David, the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, who has been with me \textit{for days and years}? I have not found anything \textit{threatening} in him from the day of his desertion until this day!”
\verse But the commanders of \textit{the} Philistines were angry with him and they said to him, “Send the man back so that he might return to his place where you have assigned him! But he will not go down with us into the battle, so that he does not become an adversary to us in the battle. By what could this fellow make himself favorable to his lord? Is it not with the heads of these men?
\verse \textit{Is} this not David about whom they sing in the dances, saying,
\verse So Achish called David and said to him, “\textit{As Adonai lives}, certainly you were honest, and \textit{I am pleased to have you marching with me} in the campaign. For I have not found any wrong in you from the day you came to me until this day, but in the eyes of the rulers, you \textit{are} not good.
\verse So then, return and go in peace, so that you do not do \textit{something that displeases} the rulers of \textit{the} Philistines.”
\verse Then David said to Achish, “But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant from the day that I \textit{entered your service} until this day, that I should not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”
\verse And Achish answered and said to David, “I know that you \textit{are} good in my eyes, like an angel of God! However, the commanders of \textit{the} Philistines have said, ‘He must not go up with us into the battle.’
\verse So then, rise early in the morning, \textit{you} and the servants of your lord who came with you. When you rise early in the morning and it is light \textit{enough} for you, leave.

\verseWithHeading{David Recovers His Loved Ones} \textit{Now} when David and his men came \textit{to} Ziklag on the third day, \textit{the} Amalekites had raided \textit{the} Negev and Ziklag. When they attacked Ziklag, they burned it with fire.
\verse They took captive the women who were in it, \textit{from the youngest to the oldest}. They did not kill anyone, but carried \textit{them} off and went on their way.
\verse When David and his men came to the city, \textit{they saw}, and \textit{it} was burned with fire, and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive.
\verse Then David and the people who \textit{were} with him raised their voices and wept until there was not \textit{enough} strength in them to weep.
\verse Two of David’s wives had been taken captive. Ahinoam \textit{from Jezreel} and Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
\verse And \textit{David was in a very precarious situation}, for the people spoke of stoning him, for the souls of all the people were bitter, each \textit{one} over his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in Adonai his God.
\verse Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring the ephod here for me.” So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
\verse And David inquired of Adonai, saying, “Should I pursue after this band \textit{of raiders}? Will I overtake them?” He said to him, “Pursue \textit{them}, for you will certainly overtake them, and you will certainly rescue them.”
\verse So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and they came to the Wadi Besor, but the rest remained.
\verse David pursued, he and four hundred men; but two hundred men stayed because they were too exhausted to pass over the Wadi Besor.
\verse Then they found an Egyptian man in the open country and brought him to David, and they gave him food and he ate; they also gave him water.
\verse They gave him a slice of fig cake and two raisin cakes; he ate and \textit{this revived him}, because he had not eaten food or drunk water \textit{for} three days and three nights.
\verse Then David said to him, “\textit{To whom do you belong}, and from where \textit{are} you? The young man said, “I am an Egyptian young man, a servant of an Amalekite man, but my master abandoned me because I became ill three days ago.
\verse We raided the Negev of the Kerethites and that \textit{which belongs} to Judah and then the Negev of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.”
\verse So David asked him, “Will you take me down to this band \textit{of raiders}?” He said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me and that you will not deliver me into my master’s hand! Then I will take you down to this band.”
\verse So he took him down, and \textit{there they were}, spread out over the surface of all the land, eating and drinking and dancing because of all of the abundant plunder which they had taken from the land of \textit{the} Philistines and from the land of Judah.
\verse Then David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped \textit{except} four hundred young men who rode \textit{off} on camels and fled.
\verse So David recovered all that \textit{the} Amalekites had taken; David also rescued his two wives.
\verse None of theirs \textit{was} missing \textit{from the smallest to the greatest}, even sons and daughters, from \textit{the} plunder up to everything they had taken for themselves; David brought back everything.
\verse And David took all of the sheep, and the cattle they drove along in front of that livestock, and they said, “This \textit{is} David’s plunder.”
\verse Then David came to \textit{the} two hundred men \textit{who had been too exhausted to follow} David; they had left them behind at the Wadi Besor. They went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him. David came near with the people and \textit{asked them how they were doing}.
\verse Then all the corrupt and useless men among the men who went with David reacted and said, “Because they did not go with us, we will not give them \textit{anything} from the plunder which we recovered, \textit{except} each \textit{man may take} his own wife and children. They must take them along and go!”
\verse But David said to them, “You should not do so, my brothers, with what Adonai has given to us! He has preserved us and has given the \textit{raiding} band that came against us into our hand.
\verse And who would listen to you regarding this matter? For as the share of the one who went down into the battle, so the share of the one who remained with the baggage will be. They will share alike.”
\verse So from that day and beyond, he made it a rule and a regulation for Israel until this day.
\verse Then David came to Ziklag, and he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, “\textit{Here is} a gift for you from the plunder of the enemies of Adonai!”
\verse \textit{It was} for those in Bethel, for those in Ramoth of the Negev, for those in Jattir,
\verse for those in Aroer, for those in Siphmoth, for those in Eshtemoa,
\verse for those in Racal, for those in the towns of the Jerahmeelites, for those in the towns of the Kenites,
