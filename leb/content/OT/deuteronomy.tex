\verseWithHeading{Preamble}{These are the words that Moses spoke to all of Israel \textit{on the other side of}\lnDWA{}the Jordan in the desert,\lebnote{Or “the wilderness”}in the desert plateau\lebnote{Or “desert plain”; others render this as a named location, “Arabah”}opposite Suph, between Paran and between Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab.}%
\verse{It is a journey of \textit{eleven days}\lebnote{“one and ten days”}from Herob \textit{by the way of Mount Seir}\lebnote{“by the mountain of Seir”}up to Kadesh Barnea.}%
\verse{\textit{And it was}\lebnote{“and it happened” or “and then”}in the fortieth year, on the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the \textit{Israelites}\lnAKM{}according to all that Adonai had instructed him to speak to them.}%
\verse{This happened \textit{after defeating}\lebnote{“after he had struck down”}Sihon king of the Amorites, who was reigning\lnDWC{}in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who was reigning\lnDWC{}in Ashtaroth in Edrei.}%
\verse{On the other side of \lnDWA{}the Jordan in the land of Moab Moses began to explain this law,\lnDWF{}\textit{saying}:\lnDWG{}}%
\verseWithHeading{Historical Prologue}{“Adonai our God spoke to us at Horeb, \textit{saying},\lnDWG{}‘You have stayed \textit{long enough}\lebnote{“much time”}at this mountain.}%
\verse{Turn now and \textit{move on},\lebnote{“journey on with respect to yourselves” or “move yourselves out”}and go into the hill of the Amorites\lnAMK{}and to all of the neighboring regions\lnDWJ{}in the Jordan \textit{Valley}\lebnote{“Arabah,” arid stretches of land.}in the hill country and in the Negev and in the coastal area along the sea, into the land of the Canaanites\lnAMI{}and into the Lebanon, as far as the great river Euphrates.}%
\verse{Look, I have set the land \textit{before you};\lebnote{“before your face”}go and take possession of the land that Adonai swore to your ancestors,\lnAGP{}to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give it to them and to their offspring after them.’}%
\verse{“And I spoke to them at that time, \textit{saying},\lnDWG{}‘I am not able to bear you alone.}%
\verse{Adonai your God has multiplied you, and look; you are today as the stars of the heaven \textit{in number}.\lebnote{“with respect to multitude/abundance”}}%
\verse{Adonai, the God of your ancestors,\lnAGP{}may he add to you as you are now a thousand times, and may he bless you just as he \textit{promised you}.\lebnote{“spoke to you”}}%
\verse{How can I bear you \textit{by myself},\lebnote{“to me alone”}your burden and your load and your strife?}%
\verse{Choose for yourselves \textit{wise and discerning and knowledgeable men}\lebnote{“men wise and discerning and knowledgeable”}for each of your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.’}%
\verse{“And you answered me, and you said, ‘The thing you have said to do is good.’}%
\verse{And so I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and then I appointed them as leaders over you as commanders of groups of thousands and commanders of groups of hundreds and commanders of groups of fifties and commanders of groups of tens as officials for your tribes.}%
\verse{And at that time I instructed your judges, saying, ‘\textit{hear out your fellow men},\lebnote{“hear between your brothers,” with the idea of listening carefully in this context}and then judge fairly\lebnote{Or “righteously”}between a man and between his brother and between \textit{his opponent who is a resident alien}.\lebnote{“between his resident alien/non-Israelite who dwells temporarily among Israel”}}%
\verse{You must not \textit{be partial}\lebnote{“recognize faces”}\textit{in your judgment}; \lebnote{“in the process of rendering a judgment”}hear out the small person as also the great person; \textit{do not be intimidated by any person},\lebnote{“do not fear before the faces of any man”}because the judgment is God’s; and the case that is too difficult\lebnote{Or “hard”}for you, bring it to me, and I will hear it out.’}%
\verse{And so I instructed you at that time concerning all of the things that you should do.}%
\verse{“Then we set out from Horeb, and we went through the whole of that great and terrible desert that you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites\lnAMK{}as Adonai our God had commanded us, and so we came up to Kadesh Barnea.}%
\verse{I said to you, ‘\textit{You have reached}\lebnote{“You have come up to”}the hill country of the Amorites\lnAMK{}that Adonai our God is giving to us.}%
\verse{See, Adonai your God has set before you the land; go up and possess it as Adonai the God of your ancestors\lnAGP{}said to you; do not fear and do not be dismayed.’}%
\verse{“Then all of you approached me, and you said, ‘Let us send men \textit{before us},\lebnote{“before our faces” or “ahead of us”}and let them explore the land for us, and let them bring back \textit{a report}\lnDWR{}to us concerning the way that \textit{we should take}\lebnote{“we should go up by it”}and concerning the cities that we shall come to.’}%
\verse{The plan was good \textit{in my opinion},\lebnote{“in my eyes”}and so I took from among you twelve men, \textit{one from each tribe}.\lebnote{“man one from the tribe”}}%
\verse{And they \textit{set out}\lebnote{“turned”}and \textit{went up into the hill country},\lebnote{“went up toward the hill country mountain”}and they went up to the wadi\lnDWS{}of Eschol, and they spied out the land.}%
\verse{They took in their hands\lebnote{Hebrew “hand”}\textit{some of the fruit}\lebnote{“from the fruit”}of the land, and they brought it down to us, and they brought to us back \textit{a report},\lnDWR{}and they said, ‘The land that Adonai our God is giving to us is good.’}%
\verse{But you were not willing to go up, and you rebelled against the \textit{command}\lnCYC{}of Adonai your God.}%
\verse{And you grumbled in your tents, and you said, ‘Because of the hatred of Adonai toward us he has brought us out from the land of Egypt to give us into the hand of the Amorites\lnAMK{}to destroy us.}%
\verse{Where can we go up? Our brothers have \textit{made our hearts melt},\lebnote{“caused to melt our hearts”}\textit{saying},\lnDWG{}“The people are greater\lebnote{Or “bigger”}and taller than we are,\lebnote{Hebrew “than us”}and there are great fortified cities reaching up to heaven, and we saw the sons of the Anakites living there.” ’}%
\verse{“And so I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified, and do not fear them.}%
\verse{Adonai your God, who is going \textit{before you},\lnCRJ{}will himself\lebnote{The Hebrew pronoun indicates emphasis}fight for you, \textit{just as}\lebnote{“like all that”}he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,}%
\verse{and just as he did in the wilderness\lebnote{Or “desert”}when\lebnote{Or “where”}you saw that\lebnote{Or “how”}Adonai your God carried you, just as someone\lebnote{Or “a man”}carries his son, all along the way that you traveled until \textit{you reached}\lebnote{“you came”}this place.’}%
\verse{But through all of this you did not trust in Adonai your God,}%
\verse{\textit{who goes}\lebnote{“is the one going”}\textit{before you}\lebnote{“before your faces”}on your\lnBBD{}way, seeking a place for your encampment, in fire at night and in a cloud by day, to show you the way that \textit{you should go}.\lebnote{“you should go in it”}}%
\verse{“Then Adonai heard the sound of your words, and he was angry, and he swore, \textit{saying},\lnDWG{}}%
\verse{‘No one of these men\lebnote{The beginning of an oath in Hebrew; the text emphatically denies anyone of that evil generation the privilege of seeing the promised land}of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors,\lnAGP{}}%
\verse{except Caleb, the son of Jephunneh; he himself\lebnote{Emphatic use of the pronoun}shall see it, and to him I will give the land upon which he has trodden and to his sons\lebnote{Or “descendants”}because \textit{he followed Adonai unreservedly}.’\lebnote{“he filled his hands after Adonai”}}%
\verse{Even with me Adonai was angry because of you, saying, ‘Not even you shall enter there.}%
\verse{Joshua, the son of Nun, \textit{your assistant},\lebnote{“the one standing before you”}will go there; encourage him because he will cause Israel to inherit it.}%
\verse{And your little children, who you thought shall become plunder, and your sons, who do not today know good or bad, shall themselves\lebnote{The Hebrew pronoun is used for emphasis}go there, and I will give it to them, and they shall take possession of it.}%
\verse{But you turn and set out in the direction of the wilderness by way of the \textit{Red Sea}.’\lebnote{“sea of reeds”}}%
\verse{“You replied and said to me, ‘We have sinned against Adonai, and now we will go up and fight according to all that Adonai our God commanded us’; and so each man fastened on \textit{his battle gear},\lebnote{“his vessels of battle”}and you regarded it as easy to go up into the hill country.}%
\verse{So Adonai said to me, ‘Say to them, “You shall not go up, and you shall not fight because I am not in your midst; you will be defeated \textit{before}\lebnote{“in the faces of your enemies”}your enemies.” ’}%
\verse{So I spoke to you, but you did not listen; you rebelled against the \textit{command of Adonai};\lnCXF{}you behaved presumptuously, and you went up into the hill country.}%
\verse{The Amorites living in the hill country went out \textit{to oppose you}\lebnote{“to meet you”}and chased you as a swarm of wild honey bees do; and so they \textit{beat}\lnAGQ{}you down in Seir as far as Hormah.}%
\verse{So you returned and wept \textit{before Adonai};\lebnote{“before the faces of Adonai”}but Adonai did not listen to your voice and did not pay any attention to you.}%
\verse{You stayed in Kadesh many days; such were the days that you stayed there.}%
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 2
\verse{“Then we turned and set out toward the wilderness\lebnote{Or “desert”}in the direction of the \textit{Red Sea},\lebnote{“sea of reeds”}as Adonai told me, and we went around Mount Seir for many days.}%
\verse{Adonai spoke to me, \textit{saying},\lnDWG{}}%
\verse{‘Long enough you have been skirting this mountain; turn yourselves north,}%
\verse{and instruct\lebnote{Or “command”}the people, \textit{saying},\lnDWG{}“You are about to cross through the territory of your brothers, the descendants\lnAFK{}of Esau, who are living in Seir; they will be afraid of you, and so be very careful.}%
\verse{Do not get involved in battle\lebnote{Or “provoke”}with them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even \textit{a foot’s breadth}\lebnote{“a sole’s foot of space”}of it; since I have given Mount Seir as a possession for Esau.}%
\verse{You shall buy food from them so that you may eat; and also you shall purchase water from them with money so that you may drink.}%
\verse{The fact of the matter is, Adonai your God has blessed you in \textit{all the work you have done};\lebnote{“the work of your hand”}he knows \textit{your travels}\lebnote{“your journeying”}with respect to this great wilderness; forty years Adonai your God has been with you; you have not lacked a thing.” ’}%
\verse{And so we passed by our brothers, the descendants\lnAFK{}of Esau, who live in Seir, past the road of the Arabah,\lebnote{Or “Jordan Valley” since the Arabah is an extension of it}from Elath and Ezion Geber, and we turned and traveled along the route of the desert\lnDXH{}of Moab.}%
\verse{And Adonai said to me, ‘You shall not attack Moab, and you shall not engage in war\lebnote{Or “battle”}with them, for I will not give you any of his land as a possession; I have given Ar to the descendants\lnAFK{}of Lot as a possession.’}%
\verse{(The Emim previously lived in it, a people large,\lebnote{Or “great” in the sense of influential}numerous, and tall, like the Anakites.}%
\verse{They were reckoned also as Rephaim as the Anakites were; but the Moabites called them Emim.}%
\verse{The Horites previously lived in Seir, but the descendants\lnAFK{}of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them \textit{from among themselves},\lebnote{“from their presence”}as Israel did with respect to the land of their\lebnote{“its/his”}possession that Adonai gave to them.)}%
\verse{So now arise and cross over the wadi\lnDWS{}of Zered yourselves; and so we crossed the wadi\lnDWS{}of Zered.}%
\verse{Now the \textit{length of time}\lebnote{“days”}that we had traveled from Kadesh Barnea until the time when we crossed the wadi\lnDWS{}of Zered was thirty-eight years, until the perishing of all of that generation; that is, the men of war from the midst of the camp as Adonai had sworn to them.}%
\verse{The hand of Adonai was against them to root them out from the midst of the camp until they perished completely.}%
\verse{“\textit{And then}\lnDXN{}when all the men of war\lebnote{Or “battle”}\textit{had died}\lebnote{“had finished/completed to die”}from among the people,}%
\verse{Adonai spoke to me, \textit{saying},\lnDWG{}}%
\verse{‘You are about to cross over the boundary of Moab \textit{today}\lnDXP{}at Ar.}%
\verse{When you approach \textit{the border of}\lebnote{“opposite”}the \textit{Ammonites},\lnDXQ{}you shall not harass them, and you shall not get involved in battle with them, for I have not given the land of \textit{the Ammonites}\lnDXQ{}to you as a possession; because I have given it to the descendants\lnAFK{}of Lot as a possession.}%
\verse{(It is also considered the land of Rephaim; Rephaim lived in it \textit{previously},\lebnote{“before”}and the Ammonites called them Zamzummim,}%
\verse{a people great and numerous and as tall as the Anakites; Adonai destroyed them from before them,\lebnote{That is, the Ammonites}and they dispossessed them and settled in place of them,}%
\verse{just as he did for the descendants\lnAFK{}of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from \textit{before them}\lebnote{“from the face/presence of them”}and dispossessed them, and then they settled in their\lebnote{Hebrew “them”}place up to this day.}%
\verse{And also the Avvites, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, and the Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, destroyed them and then settled in their place.}%
\verse{Arise,\lebnote{Or “Get up”}set out and cross over the wadi\lnDWS{}of Arnon. Look! I have given Sihon the Amorite, the king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand; begin to take possession of it, and engage with him in battle.}%
\verse{This day I will begin to place \textit{the dread of you}\lebnote{“your dread”}and the fear of you \textit{before}\lebnote{“upon the faces of”}the peoples under all the heavens. They will hear \textit{the report about you},\lebnote{“your report”}and so they will shake and tremble \textit{because of you}.’ \lebnote{“from before you”}}%
\verse{“So I sent messengers from the wilderness\lebnote{Or “desert”}of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon; I sent terms of peace, \textit{saying},\lnDWG{}}%
\verse{‘Let me cross through your land and \textit{only along the road}\lebnote{“in the road, in the road”}I will go; I will not turn aside to the right or to the left.}%
\verse{Food for money you shall sell me, so that I may eat, and water for money you will give to me, so that I may drink; just let me cross on foot.}%
\verse{Just as the descendants\lebnote{Or “the children/sons of”}of Esau did for me, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, until I cross the Jordan into the land that Adonai our God is giving to us.’}%
\verse{But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing to let us cross through his territory because Adonai your God hardened his spirit and \textit{made him obstinate}\lebnote{“made firm his heart”}\textit{in order to give him}\lebnote{“to give him,” indicating purpose}into your hand, \textit{just as he has now done}.\lebnote{“as it is this day”}}%
\verse{Adonai said to me, ‘Look! I have begun to give \textit{over to you}\lnDXW{}Sihon and his land; begin \textit{to take possession of his land}.’\lebnote{“take possession in order to possess his land”}}%
\verse{Then Sihon and all his people came out to meet us for battle at Jahaz.}%
\verse{And so Adonai our God gave him over \textit{to us},\lnDXX{}and we struck him down, and his sons\lebnote{Or “descendants”}and all of his people.}%
\verse{So we captured all of his cities at that time, and we destroyed each town of males and the women and the children; we did not leave behind a survivor.}%
\verse{We took only the livestock as spoil for ourselves,\lebnote{Hebrew “us”}and also the booty of the cities that we had captured.}%
\verse{From Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi\lnDWS{}of Arnon and the city that was in the wadi\lnDWS{}on up to Gilead, there was not a city that was inaccessible to us; Adonai our God gave \textit{everything}\lebnote{“the whole”}\textit{to us}.\lnDXX{}}%
\verse{Only the land of \textit{the Ammonites}\lebnote{“children/sons of Ammon”}you did not approach, all along the whole upper region of the Jabbok \textit{River}\lebnote{“wadi,” which here refers to a flowing river}and the towns of the hill country, according to all that Adonai our God had instructed.}%

\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 3
\verse{“Then we turned, and we went up the road to Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us, he and all of his army for the battle at Edrei.}%
\verse{And Adonai said to me, ‘You should not fear him, for I have given him and all of his army\lnDYB{}and his land into your hand. And so you will do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites,\lnAMK{}who was reigning in Heshbon.’}%
\verse{And so Adonai our God also gave Og the king of Bashan, and all of his army\lnDYB{}into our hand, and we struck him down until not a survivor remained to\lnBDW{}him.}%
\verse{And we captured all of his towns\lebnote{Or “villages/cities small”}at that time; there was not a city that we did not take from them.}%
\verse{All of these were fortified towns with high walls, gates, and bars,\lebnote{Hebrew “bar”}\textit{apart from}\lebnote{“alone from”}very many of the villages of the open country.}%
\verse{And so we destroyed them just as we had done to Sihon the king of Heshbon; we destroyed utterly each town of males, the women, and the little children.}%
\verse{But all of the livestock and the booty of the towns we kept as spoil for ourselves.\lebnote{Hebrew “us”}}%
\verse{“And so we took at that time the land from \textit{the control of}\lebnote{“the hand of”}the two kings of the Amorites\lnAMK{}who were \textit{on the other side of the Jordan},\lebnote{“in the beyond of the Jordan”}from the wadi\lnDWS{}of Arnon up to \textit{Mount Hermon}.\lebnote{“the mountain of Hermon”}}%
\verse{(The Sidonians called Hermon ‘Sirion,’ and the Amorites called it ‘Senir.’)}%
\verse{All of the towns of the plateau and the whole of Gilead and all of Bashan up to Salecah and Edrei, the towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.}%
\verse{(For only Og, king of Bashan, was left from the remnant of the Rephaim. Indeed, his bedstead—it was a bedstead of iron. It is in Rabbah of the \textit{Ammonites}.\lnAIA{}Nine cubits is its length, and four cubits is its width according to the cubit of a man.)}%
\verse{And so we took possession of this land at that time, from Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi\lnDWS{}of Arnon, and also half of the hill country of Gilead and its towns I gave to the Reubenites\lnDOX{}and to the Gadites.\lnDUO{}}%
\verse{And the remainder of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the whole region of Argo. All of that area of Bashan was called the land of the Rephaim.}%
\verse{Jair the descendant\lnALU{}of Manasseh acquired the whole region of Argob, up to the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and he called it,\lebnote{Hebrew “them”}that is Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, \textit{as it still is today}.\lebnote{“up to this day”}}%
\verse{And also I gave Gilead to Makir.}%
\verse{And to the Reubenites\lnDOX{}and to the Gadites\lnDUO{}I gave, from Gilead up to the wadi\lnDWS{}of Arnon, the middle of the wadi\lnDWS{}as a boundary and up to the Jabbok \textit{River},\lebnote{“wadi,” which here refers to a flowing river}the boundary of the \textit{Ammonites}.\lnAIA{}}%
\verse{And the \textit{Jordan Valley}\lebnote{“Arabah”}with the Jordan River as its boundary, from Kinnereth\lebnote{Or “Chinnereth,” the Sea of Galilee}up to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea,\lebnote{Or the Dead Sea}with the slopes of Pisgah toward the east.}%
\verse{“And I charged you all at that time when I said, “Adonai has given you—to all of you—this land to possess. All the \textit{warriors}\lebnote{“men of valor”}shall cross over, ready to fight, before your brothers, the \textit{Israelites}.\lnAKM{}}%
\verse{Only your wives and your little children and your livestock (I know that \textit{you have much livestock})\lebnote{“livestock much there is to you”}must stay in your towns that I have given you,}%
\verse{until Adonai shall give rest to your brothers as he did to you, and also they take possession of the land that Adonai your God is giving to them beyond the Jordan; then they may return, each one to his possession that I have given to them.}%
\verse{And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes see all that Adonai your God has done to these two kings; so Adonai will do to all of the kingdoms where you are about to cross over to.}%
\verse{You shall not fear them, for Adonai your God is the one fighting for you.}%
\verse{“And I pleaded with Adonai at that time, saying,}%
\verse{‘Lord Adonai, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your strong hand, for what\lebnote{Hebrew “who”}god is there in the heaven or on the earth who can do according to your works and according to your mighty deeds?}%
\verse{Let me cross over, please, and let me see the good land \textit{that is beyond the Jordan},\lebnote{“in the beyond of the Jordan”}this good hill country and Lebanon.’}%
\verse{But Adonai was very angry with me because of you, and he would not listen to me, and Adonai said, ‘\textit{Enough of that from you}!\lebnote{“Much to you”}You shall not speak to me any longer about this matter!}%
\verse{Go up to the top of Pisgah and \textit{look around you}\lebnote{“lift up your eyes”}toward the west, toward the north, and toward the east, and \textit{view}\lnAOS{}the land with your eyes, for you will not cross this Jordan.}%
\verse{Now instruct Joshua and support him and encourage him because he himself\lebnote{Emphatic use of the pronoun}will cross over before this people and enable them to inherit the land that you will see.’}%
