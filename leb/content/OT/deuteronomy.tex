\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 1
\verseWithHeading{Preamble} These are the words that Moses spoke to all of Israel \textit{on the other side of} the Jordan in the desert, in the desert plateau opposite Suph, between Paran and between Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab.
\verse It is a journey of \textit{eleven days} from Herob \textit{by the way of Mount Seir} up to Kadesh Barnea.
\verse \textit{And it was} in the fortieth year, on the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the \textit{Israelites} according to all that Adonai had instructed him to speak to them.
\verse This happened \textit{after defeating} Sihon king of the Amorites, who was reigning in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who was reigning in Ashtaroth in Edrei.
\verse On the other side of  the Jordan in the land of Moab Moses began to explain this law, \textit{saying}:
\verseWithHeading{Historical Prologue} “Adonai our God spoke to us at Horeb, \textit{saying}, ‘You have stayed \textit{long enough} at this mountain.
\verse Turn now and \textit{move on}, and go into the hill of the Amorites and to all of the neighboring regions in the Jordan \textit{Valley} in the hill country and in the Negev and in the coastal area along the sea, into the land of the Canaanites and into the Lebanon, as far as the great river Euphrates.
\verse Look, I have set the land \textit{before you}; go and take possession of the land that Adonai swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give it to them and to their offspring after them.’
\verse “And I spoke to them at that time, \textit{saying}, ‘I am not able to bear you alone.
\verse Adonai your God has multiplied you, and look; you are today as the stars of the heaven \textit{in number}.
\verse Adonai, the God of your ancestors, may he add to you as you are now a thousand times, and may he bless you just as he \textit{promised you}.
\verse How can I bear you \textit{by myself}, your burden and your load and your strife?
\verse Choose for yourselves \textit{wise and discerning and knowledgeable men} for each of your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.’
\verse “And you answered me, and you said, ‘The thing you have said to do is good.’
\verse And so I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and then I appointed them as leaders over you as commanders of groups of thousands and commanders of groups of hundreds and commanders of groups of fifties and commanders of groups of tens as officials for your tribes.
\verse And at that time I instructed your judges, saying, ‘\textit{hear out your fellow men}, and then judge fairly between a man and between his brother and between \textit{his opponent who is a resident alien}.
\verse You must not \textit{be partial} \textit{in your judgment};  hear out the small person as also the great person; \textit{do not be intimidated by any person}, because the judgment is God’s; and the case that is too difficult for you, bring it to me, and I will hear it out.’
\verse And so I instructed you at that time concerning all of the things that you should do.
\verse “Then we set out from Horeb, and we went through the whole of that great and terrible desert that you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites as Adonai our God had commanded us, and so we came up to Kadesh Barnea.
\verse I said to you, ‘\textit{You have reached} the hill country of the Amorites that Adonai our God is giving to us.
\verse See, Adonai your God has set before you the land; go up and possess it as Adonai the God of your ancestors said to you; do not fear and do not be dismayed.’
\verse “Then all of you approached me, and you said, ‘Let us send men \textit{before us}, and let them explore the land for us, and let them bring back \textit{a report} to us concerning the way that \textit{we should take} and concerning the cities that we shall come to.’
\verse The plan was good \textit{in my opinion}, and so I took from among you twelve men, \textit{one from each tribe}.
\verse And they \textit{set out} and \textit{went up into the hill country}, and they went up to the wadi of Eschol, and they spied out the land.
\verse They took in their hands \textit{some of the fruit} of the land, and they brought it down to us, and they brought to us back \textit{a report}, and they said, ‘The land that Adonai our God is giving to us is good.’
\verse But you were not willing to go up, and you rebelled against the \textit{command} of Adonai your God.
\verse And you grumbled in your tents, and you said, ‘Because of the hatred of Adonai toward us he has brought us out from the land of Egypt to give us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.
\verse Where can we go up? Our brothers have \textit{made our hearts melt}, \textit{saying}, “The people are greater and taller than we are, and there are great fortified cities reaching up to heaven, and we saw the sons of the Anakites living there.” ’
\verse “And so I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified, and do not fear them.
\verse Adonai your God, who is going \textit{before you}, will himself fight for you, \textit{just as} he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
\verse and just as he did in the wilderness when you saw that Adonai your God carried you, just as someone carries his son, all along the way that you traveled until \textit{you reached} this place.’
\verse But through all of this you did not trust in Adonai your God,
\verse \textit{who goes} \textit{before you} on your way, seeking a place for your encampment, in fire at night and in a cloud by day, to show you the way that \textit{you should go}.
\verse “Then Adonai heard the sound of your words, and he was angry, and he swore, \textit{saying},
\verse ‘No one of these men of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors,
\verse except Caleb, the son of Jephunneh; he himself shall see it, and to him I will give the land upon which he has trodden and to his sons because \textit{he followed Adonai unreservedly}.’
\verse Even with me Adonai was angry because of you, saying, ‘Not even you shall enter there.
\verse Joshua, the son of Nun, \textit{your assistant}, will go there; encourage him because he will cause Israel to inherit it.
\verse And your little children, who you thought shall become plunder, and your sons, who do not today know good or bad, shall themselves go there, and I will give it to them, and they shall take possession of it.
\verse But you turn and set out in the direction of the wilderness by way of the \textit{Red Sea}.’
\verse “You replied and said to me, ‘We have sinned against Adonai, and now we will go up and fight according to all that Adonai our God commanded us’; and so each man fastened on \textit{his battle gear}, and you regarded it as easy to go up into the hill country.
\verse So Adonai said to me, ‘Say to them, “You shall not go up, and you shall not fight because I am not in your midst; you will be defeated \textit{before} your enemies.” ’
\verse So I spoke to you, but you did not listen; you rebelled against the \textit{command of Adonai}; you behaved presumptuously, and you went up into the hill country.
\verse The Amorites living in the hill country went out \textit{to oppose you} and chased you as a swarm of wild honey bees do; and so they \textit{beat} you down in Seir as far as Hormah.
\verse So you returned and wept \textit{before Adonai}; but Adonai did not listen to your voice and did not pay any attention to you.
\verse You stayed in Kadesh many days; such were the days that you stayed there.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 2
\verse “Then we turned and set out toward the wilderness in the direction of the \textit{Red Sea}, as Adonai told me, and we went around Mount Seir for many days.
\verse Adonai spoke to me, \textit{saying},
\verse ‘Long enough you have been skirting this mountain; turn yourselves north,
\verse and instruct the people, \textit{saying}, “You are about to cross through the territory of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who are living in Seir; they will be afraid of you, and so be very careful.
\verse Do not get involved in battle with them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even \textit{a foot’s breadth} of it; since I have given Mount Seir as a possession for Esau.
\verse You shall buy food from them so that you may eat; and also you shall purchase water from them with money so that you may drink.
\verse The fact of the matter is, Adonai your God has blessed you in \textit{all the work you have done}; he knows \textit{your travels} with respect to this great wilderness; forty years Adonai your God has been with you; you have not lacked a thing.” ’
\verse And so we passed by our brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, past the road of the Arabah, from Elath and Ezion Geber, and we turned and traveled along the route of the desert of Moab.
\verse And Adonai said to me, ‘You shall not attack Moab, and you shall not engage in war with them, for I will not give you any of his land as a possession; I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.’
\verse (The Emim previously lived in it, a people large, numerous, and tall, like the Anakites.
\verse They were reckoned also as Rephaim as the Anakites were; but the Moabites called them Emim.
\verse The Horites previously lived in Seir, but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them \textit{from among themselves}, as Israel did with respect to the land of their possession that Adonai gave to them.)
\verse So now arise and cross over the wadi of Zered yourselves; and so we crossed the wadi of Zered.
\verse Now the \textit{length of time} that we had traveled from Kadesh Barnea until the time when we crossed the wadi of Zered was thirty-eight years, until the perishing of all of that generation; that is, the men of war from the midst of the camp as Adonai had sworn to them.
\verse The hand of Adonai was against them to root them out from the midst of the camp until they perished completely.
\verse “\textit{And then} when all the men of war \textit{had died} from among the people,
\verse Adonai spoke to me, \textit{saying},
\verse ‘You are about to cross over the boundary of Moab \textit{today} at Ar.
\verse When you approach \textit{the border of} the \textit{Ammonites}, you shall not harass them, and you shall not get involved in battle with them, for I have not given the land of \textit{the Ammonites} to you as a possession; because I have given it to the descendants of Lot as a possession.
\verse (It is also considered the land of Rephaim; Rephaim lived in it \textit{previously}, and the Ammonites called them Zamzummim,
\verse a people great and numerous and as tall as the Anakites; Adonai destroyed them from before them, and they dispossessed them and settled in place of them,
\verse just as he did for the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from \textit{before them} and dispossessed them, and then they settled in their place up to this day.
\verse And also the Avvites, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, and the Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, destroyed them and then settled in their place.
\verse Arise, set out and cross over the wadi of Arnon. Look! I have given Sihon the Amorite, the king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand; begin to take possession of it, and engage with him in battle.
\verse This day I will begin to place \textit{the dread of you} and the fear of you \textit{before} the peoples under all the heavens. They will hear \textit{the report about you}, and so they will shake and tremble \textit{because of you}.’ 
\verse “So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon; I sent terms of peace, \textit{saying},
\verse ‘Let me cross through your land and \textit{only along the road} I will go; I will not turn aside to the right or to the left.
\verse Food for money you shall sell me, so that I may eat, and water for money you will give to me, so that I may drink; just let me cross on foot.
\verse Just as the descendants of Esau did for me, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, until I cross the Jordan into the land that Adonai our God is giving to us.’
\verse But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing to let us cross through his territory because Adonai your God hardened his spirit and \textit{made him obstinate} \textit{in order to give him} into your hand, \textit{just as he has now done}.
\verse Adonai said to me, ‘Look! I have begun to give \textit{over to you} Sihon and his land; begin \textit{to take possession of his land}.’
\verse Then Sihon and all his people came out to meet us for battle at Jahaz.
\verse And so Adonai our God gave him over \textit{to us}, and we struck him down, and his sons and all of his people.
\verse So we captured all of his cities at that time, and we destroyed each town of males and the women and the children; we did not leave behind a survivor.
\verse We took only the livestock as spoil for ourselves, and also the booty of the cities that we had captured.
\verse From Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi of Arnon and the city that was in the wadi on up to Gilead, there was not a city that was inaccessible to us; Adonai our God gave \textit{everything} \textit{to us}.
\verse Only the land of \textit{the Ammonites} you did not approach, all along the whole upper region of the Jabbok \textit{River} and the towns of the hill country, according to all that Adonai our God had instructed.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 3
\verse “Then we turned, and we went up the road to Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us, he and all of his army for the battle at Edrei.
\verse And Adonai said to me, ‘You should not fear him, for I have given him and all of his army and his land into your hand. And so you will do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who was reigning in Heshbon.’
\verse And so Adonai our God also gave Og the king of Bashan, and all of his army into our hand, and we struck him down until not a survivor remained to him.
\verse And we captured all of his towns at that time; there was not a city that we did not take from them.
\verse All of these were fortified towns with high walls, gates, and bars, \textit{apart from} very many of the villages of the open country.
\verse And so we destroyed them just as we had done to Sihon the king of Heshbon; we destroyed utterly each town of males, the women, and the little children.
\verse But all of the livestock and the booty of the towns we kept as spoil for ourselves.
\verse “And so we took at that time the land from \textit{the control of} the two kings of the Amorites who were \textit{on the other side of the Jordan}, from the wadi of Arnon up to \textit{Mount Hermon}.
\verse (The Sidonians called Hermon ‘Sirion,’ and the Amorites called it ‘Senir.’)
\verse All of the towns of the plateau and the whole of Gilead and all of Bashan up to Salecah and Edrei, the towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\verse (For only Og, king of Bashan, was left from the remnant of the Rephaim. Indeed, his bedstead—it was a bedstead of iron. It is in Rabbah of the \textit{Ammonites}. Nine cubits is its length, and four cubits is its width according to the cubit of a man.)
\verse And so we took possession of this land at that time, from Aroer, which is on the edge of the wadi of Arnon, and also half of the hill country of Gilead and its towns I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
\verse And the remainder of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the whole region of Argo. All of that area of Bashan was called the land of the Rephaim.
\verse Jair the descendant of Manasseh acquired the whole region of Argob, up to the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and he called it, that is Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, \textit{as it still is today}.
\verse And also I gave Gilead to Makir.
\verse And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave, from Gilead up to the wadi of Arnon, the middle of the wadi as a boundary and up to the Jabbok \textit{River}, the boundary of the \textit{Ammonites}.
\verse And the \textit{Jordan Valley} with the Jordan River as its boundary, from Kinnereth up to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, with the slopes of Pisgah toward the east.
\verse “And I charged you all at that time when I said, “Adonai has given you—to all of you—this land to possess. All the \textit{warriors} shall cross over, ready to fight, before your brothers, the \textit{Israelites}.
\verse Only your wives and your little children and your livestock (I know that \textit{you have much livestock}) must stay in your towns that I have given you,
\verse until Adonai shall give rest to your brothers as he did to you, and also they take possession of the land that Adonai your God is giving to them beyond the Jordan; then they may return, each one to his possession that I have given to them.
\verse And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes see all that Adonai your God has done to these two kings; so Adonai will do to all of the kingdoms where you are about to cross over to.
\verse You shall not fear them, for Adonai your God is the one fighting for you.
\verse “And I pleaded with Adonai at that time, saying,
\verse ‘Lord Adonai, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your strong hand, for what god is there in the heaven or on the earth who can do according to your works and according to your mighty deeds?
\verse Let me cross over, please, and let me see the good land \textit{that is beyond the Jordan}, this good hill country and Lebanon.’
\verse But Adonai was very angry with me because of you, and he would not listen to me, and Adonai said, ‘\textit{Enough of that from you}! You shall not speak to me any longer about this matter!
\verse Go up to the top of Pisgah and \textit{look around you} toward the west, toward the north, and toward the east, and \textit{view} the land with your eyes, for you will not cross this Jordan.
\verse Now instruct Joshua and support him and encourage him because he himself will cross over before this people and enable them to inherit the land that you will see.’
\verse So we remained in the valley opposite Beth Peor.

\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 4
\verseWithHeading{Introduction to the Stipulations} “Now, Israel, listen to the rules and to the regulations that I am teaching you to do, in order that you may live and you may go in and you may take possession of the land that Adonai, the God of your ancestors, is giving to you.
\verse You must not add to the word that I am commanding you, and you shall not take away from it in order to keep the commands of Adonai your God that I am commanding you to observe.
\verse Your eyes have seen what Adonai did with the case of Baal Peor, for \textit{each} man that followed after Baal Peor Adonai your God destroyed from your midst.
\verse But you, the ones holding fast to Adonai your God, are all alive \textit{today}.
\verse See, I now teach you rules and regulations just as Adonai my God has commanded me, to observe them just so in the midst of the land where you are going, to take possession of it.
\verse And \textit{you must observe them diligently}, for that is your wisdom and your insight before the eyes of the people, who will hear all of these rules, and they will say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and discerning people.’
\verse For what great nation has for it a god near to it as Adonai our God, whenever we call upon him?
\verse And what other great nation has for it just rules and regulations just like \textit{this whole} law that I am setting \textit{before} you \textit{today}?
\verse “However, \textit{take care} for yourself and watch your inner self closely, so that you do not forget the things that your eyes have seen, so that they do not slip from your mind all the days of your life; and you shall make them known to your children and to \textit{your grandchildren}.
\verse Remember the day that you stood \textit{before} Adonai your God at Horeb \textit{when Adonai said to me}, ‘Summon for me the people so that I can tell them my words, that they may learn to fear me all of the days they are alive on the earth and so that they may teach their children.’
\verse And so you came near, and you stood under the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire up to the heart of the heaven, \textit{dark with a very thick cloud}.
\verse And Adonai spoke to you from the midst of the fire; \textit{you heard} a sound of words, but \textit{you did not see} a form—only a voice.
\verse And he declared to you his covenant, \textit{the Ten Commandments}, which he charged you \textit{to observe}, and he wrote them on the two tablets of stone.
\verse And Adonai charged me at that time to teach you rules and regulations \textit{for your observation of them} in the land that you are \textit{about to cross into} to take possession of it.
\verse “So \textit{you must be very careful for yourselves}, because you did not see any form on the day Adonai spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire,
\verse so that you do not \textit{ruin yourselves} and make for yourselves a divine image in a form of any image, a replica of male or female,
\verse a replica of any animal that is upon the earth, a replica of any winged bird that flies in the air,
\verse a replica of any creeping thing on the ground, a replica of any fish that is in the water \textit{below} the earth.
\verse \textit{And do this so that you do not lift} your eyes toward heaven and \textit{observe} the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of the heaven, and be led astray and bow down to them and serve them, things that Adonai your God has allotted to all of the peoples under all of the heaven.
\verse But Adonai has taken you and brought you out from the furnace of iron, from Egypt, to be a people of inheritance to him, \textit{as it is this day}.
\verse “And Adonai was angry with me \textit{because of you}, and he swore \textit{that I would not cross the Jordan} and \textit{that I would not go to the good land} that Adonai your God is giving you as an inheritance.
\verse For I am going to die in this land; I am not going to cross the Jordan, but you are going to cross, and you are going to take possession of this good land.
\verse Watch out for yourselves so that you do not forget the covenant of Adonai your God that he had \textit{made} with you and make for yourselves a divine image of the form of anything that Adonai your God \textit{has forbidden},
\verse for Adonai your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.
\verse “When you have had children and \textit{grandchildren} and you have grown old in the land and you act corruptly and you make a divine image of the form of anything and you do evil in the eyes of Adonai your God, thus provoking him to anger,
\verse I call to witness against you today the heaven and the earth, that you will perish soon and completely from the land that you are crossing the Jordan into it to take possession of it; \textit{you will not live long on it}, but you will be completely destroyed.
\verse And Adonai will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left \textit{few in number} among the nations \textit{to where Adonai will lead you}.
\verse And you will there serve gods \textit{made by human hands}, of wood and stone, gods that cannot see and cannot hear and cannot eat and cannot smell.
\verse But from there you shall seek Adonai your God and will find him, if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul.
\verse \textit{In your distress} when all these things have found you in the \textit{latter days}, then you will return to Adonai your God, and you will listen to his voice.
\verse For Adonai your God is a compassionate God; he \textit{will not abandon you}, and he will not destroy you, and he will not forget the covenant of your ancestors that he swore to them.
\verse “Yes, ask, please, about former days that \textit{preceded you} from the day that God created humankind on the earth; ask even from one end of the heaven up to the other end of heaven \textit{whether anything ever happened} like this great thing or \textit{whether anything like it was ever heard}.
\verse Has a people ever heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, just as you heard it, and lived?
\verse Or has a god ever attempted to go to take for himself a nation from the midst of a nation, using trials and signs and wonders and war, with an outstretched arm and with great and awesome deeds, like all that Adonai your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
\verse You yourselves were shown this wonder in order for you to acknowledge that Adonai is the God; there is no other God \textit{besides him}.
\verse From heaven he made you hear his voice to teach you, and on the earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from the midst of the fire.
\verse And because he loved your ancestors he chose their \textit{descendants} after them. And he brought you forth from Egypt \textit{with his own presence}, by his great strength,
\verse to drive out nations greater and more numerous than you \textit{from before you}, to bring you and to give to you their land as an inheritance, as it is this day.
\verse So you shall acknowledge \textit{today}, and \textit{you must call to mind} that Adonai is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath. There is no other God.
\verse And you shall keep his rules and his commandments that I am commanding you \textit{today}, so that \textit{it may go well} for you and for your children after you, and so that \textit{you may remain a long time} on the land that Adonai your God is giving to you during all of those days.”
\verse Then Moses set apart three cities \textit{on the other side of the Jordan}, \textit{toward the east},
\verse in order for \textit{a manslayer} to flee there who has killed his neighbor \textit{without intent} and was not hating him \textit{previously}, and so he could flee to one of these cities \textit{and be safe}.
\verse He set apart Bezer in the wilderness in the land of the plateau of the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead of the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan of the Manassites.
\verse Now this is the law that Moses set \textit{before} the \textit{Israelites};
\verse these are the legal provisions and the rules and the regulations that Moses spoke to the \textit{Israelites} \textit{when they left Egypt},
\verse beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth Peor in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who was reigning in Heshbon and whom Moses and the \textit{Israelites} defeated \textit{when they came out of Egypt}.
\verse And so they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, \textit{eastward},
\verse from Aroer, which is on the bank of the wadi of Arnon and as far as Mount Sirion; that is, Hermon,
\verse and all of the Arabah beyond the Jordan, eastward, and as far as the Sea of the Arabah under the slopes of Pisgah.

\verseWithHeading{Basic Stipulations} And then Moses summoned all of Israel and said to them, “Hear, Israel, the rules and the regulations that I am speaking in your ears \textit{today}, and you shall learn them, and \textit{you must observe them diligently}.
\verse Adonai our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
\verse It was not with our ancestors that Adonai made this covenant, but with these of us who are here alive today.
\verse \textit{Face to face} Adonai spoke with you at the mountain from the midst of the fire.
\verse I was standing \textit{between Adonai and you} at that time to report to you the word of Adonai, for you were afraid because of \textit{the presence of} the fire, and so you did not go up the mountain. \textit{He said},
\verse ‘I am Adonai your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery.
\verse There shall not be for you other gods \textit{besides me}.
\verse ‘You shall not make for yourself a divine image of any type of form that is in the heaven above or that is on the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth.
\verse ‘You shall not bow down to them, and you shall not serve them, for I, Adonai your God, am a jealous God, punishing the guilt of fathers upon their children and upon the third and upon the fourth generation of those hating me,
\verse but showing loyal love to thousands of those who love me and of those who keep my commandments.
\verse ‘You shall not take up the name of Adonai your God for a worthless purpose, for Adonai will not leave unpunished anyone who uses his name for a worthless purpose.
\verse ‘Observe the \textit{Sabbath day} to make it holy, just as Adonai your God has commanded you.
\verse Six days you shall work, and you shall do all of your work,
\verse but the seventh day is a Sabbath unto Adonai your God; you shall not do any work, or your son, or your daughter, or your slave, or your slave woman, or your ox, or your donkey, or any of your domestic animals, or your resident alien who is in your \textit{towns}, so that your slave and your slave woman may rest as you rest.
\verse And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Adonai your God brought you out with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm; therefore, Adonai your God commanded you to keep \textit{the Sabbath}.
\verse ‘Honor your father and your mother, as Adonai your God commanded you, so that it will be good for you \textit{in the land} that Adonai your God is giving to you.
\verse ‘You shall not murder.
\verse ‘And you shall not commit adultery.
\verse ‘And you shall not steal.
\verse ‘And you shall not falsely bear evidence against your neighbor.
\verse ‘And you shall not covet the wife of your neighbor, and you shall not crave the house of your neighbor, his field or his slave or his slave woman or his ox and his donkey or anything \textit{that belongs to your neighbor}.’
\verse “These words Adonai spoke to your whole assembly at the mountain from the midst of the fire and the very thick cloud with a loud voice, and \textit{he did not add anything}, and then he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.
\verse \textit{And then} \textit{when you heard} the voice from the midst of the darkness, and as the mountain was burning with fire, and and all the heads of your tribes and your elders approached me,
\verse you said, ‘Look, Adonai our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire; this day we have seen that God can speak with a human being, \textit{yet he remains alive}.
\verse And so then why shall we die, for this great fire will consume us if \textit{we continue} to hear the voice of Adonai our God any longer, and so we shall die?
\verse For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire as we have heard it \textit{and remained alive}?

\verse It is not because of your righteousness and because of the uprightness of your heart that you are coming to take possession of their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations Adonai your God is driving them \textit{before you}, and in order to confirm the \textit{promise} that Adonai swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

\verse Leave me alone, and let me destroy them, and let me blot out their name from under heaven, and let me make you into a nation mightier and more numerous than they!’

\verse And I looked, and indeed you had sinned against Adonai your God; you had made for yourselves an image of a calf of cast metal;  you had turned quickly from the way that Adonai had commanded for you.
\verse And I took hold of the two tablets, and I threw them out \textit{of} my two hands and smashed them before your eyes.
\verse And then I lay prostrate \textit{before} Adonai, as earlier, forty days and forty nights; I did not eat food and I did not drink water because of all your sins that you committed, by doing evil in the eyes of Adonai and so provoking him.
\verse For \textit{I was in dread} from being in the presence of the anger and the wrath with which Adonai was angry with you so as to destroy you, but Adonai listened to me also \textit{at that time}.

\verse And your sinful thing that you had made, the molten calf, I took and I burned it with fire, and I crushed it, grinding it thoroughly until it was crushed to dust, and I threw its dust into \textit{the stream that flowed down the mountain}.
\verse “And also at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Adonai to anger.
\verse And when Adonai sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, \textit{saying}, ‘Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you,’ you rebelled against the command of Adonai your God, and you did not believe him, and you did not listen to his voice.
\verse You have been rebellious toward Adonai \textit{from the day I have known you}.
\verse “And I lay prostrate before Adonai through forty days, and through forty nights I prostrated myself, because Adonai intended to kill you.
\verse And I prayed to Adonai, and I said, ‘Lord Adonai, you must not destroy your people and your inheritance whom you redeemed in your greatness, whom you brought out from Egypt with a strong hand.
\verse Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; you must not \textit{pay attention to} the stubbornness of this people, to their wickedness and to their sin,
\verse lest the people of the land from which you brought us out from there say, “Because Adonai was not able to bring them to the land that he \textit{promised} to them and because of his hatred toward them, he has brought them out to kill them in the desert.”

\verse Adonai will cause the plague to cling to you \textit{until it consumes you} from the land that you are going to, to take possession of it.
\verse Adonai will afflict you with the wasting diseases and with the fever and with the inflammation and with the scorching heat and with the sword and with the blight and with the mildew, and they shall pursue you \textit{until you perish}.
\verse And your heavens that are over your heads shall be like bronze, and the earth that is under you shall be like iron.
\verse Adonai will change the rain of your land to fine dust and to sand; from the heaven it shall come down upon you \textit{until you are destroyed}.
\verse “Adonai shall cause you to be defeated \textit{before} your enemies; on one road you shall go \textit{against} them, but you will flee on seven roads \textit{before} them, and you shall become a thing of horror to all of the kingdoms of the earth.
\verse And your dead bodies shall be as food for all of the birds of the heaven and to the animals of the earth, and there shall not be \textit{anyone to frighten them away}.
\verse “Adonai shall afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors and with the scurvy and with \textit{the skin rash that cannot be healed}.
\verse Adonai shall afflict you with madness and with blindness and with confusion of heart.
\verse And you shall be groping at noon just as the blind person gropes in the dark, and you shall not succeed in finding your way, and you shall only be abused and robbed \textit{all the time}, and there will not be \textit{anyone who will rescue you}. 
\verse You shall become engaged to a woman, but another man shall sleep with her; you shall build a house, but you shall not live in it; a vineyard you shall plant, but you shall not enjoy it.
\verse Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes, and you shall not eat it; your donkey shall be stolen right \textit{before you}, and it shall not be returned to you; your sheep and your goats shall be given to your enemies, and \textit{there shall not be anyone who rescues you}.
\verse Your sons and your daughters shall be given to other people, and \textit{you will be looking on} \textit{longingly} for them all day, \textit{but you will be powerless to do anything}.
\verse A people that you do not know shall consume the harvest of your land and all your labor, and you will be only oppressed and crushed \textit{for the rest of your lives}.
\verse You shall become mad \textit{because of what your eyes shall see}.
\verse Adonai shall strike you with grievous boils on the knees and on the upper thighs from which \textit{you will not be able to be healed}, from the sole of your foot and up to your crown.

\verse And you will become a horror and a proverb and ridicule among all the peoples where Adonai drives you there.
\verse “You shall carry out much seed to the field, but you shall gather little produce, for the locust shall devour it.
\verse You shall plant vineyards and you shall dress them, but you shall not drink wine and you shall not gather grapes, for the worm shall eat it.

\verse And they shall be among you as a sign and as a wonder and among your offspring \textit{forever}.
\verse “\textit{Because} of the fact that you did not serve Adonai your God with joy and with gladness of heart for the abundance of everything,
\verse then you shall serve your enemies, whom Adonai will send against you under conditions of famine, in thirst, in nakedness, and in a lack of everything; and he shall place a yoke of iron on your neck \textit{until he has destroyed you}.
\verse Adonai will raise up against you a nation from far off, from the end of the earth, attacking as the eagle swoops down, \textit{a nation whose language you will not understand},
\verse \textit{a grim-faced nation} \textit{who does not show respect} to the old and the young and does not show pity.
\verse And it shall consume the fruit of your livestock and the fruit of your ground \textit{until you are destroyed}, and who will not leave for you any grain, wine, and olive oil, \textit{calves of your herds}, and \textit{lambs of} your flock \textit{until it has destroyed you}.

\verse The most refined and the most delicate woman among you, who shall not venture to put the sole of her foot on the ground from being so delicate and from such gentleness, \textit{shall be mean to her beloved husband} and against her son and against her daughter,
\verse and even concerning her afterbirth \textit{that goes out} from between her feet and also concerning her children that she bears, because she eats them for lack of anything in secret \textit{during the siege and during the distress} that your enemy inflicts upon her in your \textit{towns}.
\verse “If \textit{you do not diligently observe} all the words of this law written in this scroll by revering this glorious and awesome name, Adonai your God,
\verse then Adonai shall overwhelm you with your plagues and the plagues of your offspring, severe plagues and lasting illnesses, grievous and enduring.
\verse And he shall bring back upon you all the diseases of Egypt concerning which \textit{you were in dread} \textit{because of them}.
\verse Also any illness and any plague that is not written in the scroll of this law, he shall bring them, Adonai, upon you until you are destroyed.
\verse And you shall remain \textit{only a few people} in place of the fact you were formerly as the stars of heaven as far as number is concerned, because you did not listen to the voice of Adonai your God.
\verse \textit{And then} as Adonai delighted over you \textit{to make you prosperous} to make you numerous, so Adonai shall delight over you to exterminate you and to destroy you, and so you shall be plucked from the land that you are going there to take possession of it.
\verse And Adonai shall scatter you among all the nations from one end of the earth up to the other end of the earth, and there you shall serve other gods that you have not known nor your ancestors, gods of wood and stone.
\verse And among these nations you shall not find rest, and there shall not be a resting place for the sole of your foot, and Adonai shall give you there an anxious heart and a weakening of eyes and a languishing of your inner self.
\verse And \textit{your life shall hang in doubt before you}, and you shall be startled night and day, and you shall not be confident of your life.
\verse In the morning you shall say, ‘\textit{If only it was evening}!’ and in the evening you shall say ‘\textit{If only it was morning}!’ because of the dread of your heart that you shall feel, and because of the sight of your eyes that you shall see.
\verse And Adonai shall bring you back to Egypt in ships by the route that I \textit{promised} to you that ‘\textit{You shall not see it again}!’ And you shall sell yourself there to your enemies as slaves and as female slaves, but there will not be a buyer.”

\verseWithHeading{Covenant Renewal, Oaths, Restoration, Charges to the Nation}  These are the words of the covenant that Adonai commanded Moses to make with the \textit{Israelites} in the land of Moab \textit{besides} the covenant that he made with them at Horeb.
\verse And Moses summoned all of Israel and said to them, “You saw all that Adonai did before your eyes in the land of Egypt and to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land;
\verse that is, the great trials that your eyes saw, and those great signs and wonders.
\verse But Adonai has not given to you a heart to understand, or eyes to see, or ears to hear, even \textit{to this day}.
\verse And I have led you forty years in the desert; your clothes have not worn out \textit{on you}, and your sandal has not worn out \textit{on your foot}.
\verse You have not eaten bread, and you have not drunk wine and strong drink, so that you may know that I am Adonai your God.
\verse And when you came to this place then Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out to meet you for battle, and we defeated them.
\verse And we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to the half-tribe of Manasseh.
\verse And \textit{you must diligently observe the words of this covenant}, so that you may succeed in all that you do.
\verse “You are standing \textit{today}, all of you, \textit{before} Adonai your God, your leaders, your tribes, your elders, and your officials, all the men of Israel,
\verse your little children, your women and your aliens who are in the midst of your camp, from the choppers of your wood to the drawers of your water,
\verse \textit{in order for you to enter into the covenant of Adonai your God}, and into his oath that Adonai your God is \textit{making with you} \textit{today},
\verse in order to establish you \textit{today} \textit{to himself} as a people and so that he may be for you as God, just as he \textit{promised} to you and \textit{just as} he swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
\verse “Now I am not \textit{making this covenant} and this oath \textit{with you alone}.
\verse But with \textit{whoever is standing here} with us \textit{today} \textit{before} Adonai our God, and with \textit{whoever is not standing here} with us \textit{today}.
\verse For you know how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we traveled through the midst of the nations that you traveled through.
\verse And you have seen their detestable things and their idols of wood and stone, silver, and gold that were among them,
\verse so that \textit{there is not} among you a man or a woman or a clan or a tribe \textit{whose heart} turns \textit{today} from being with Adonai our God to go to serve the gods of these nations, so that there is not among you a root sprouting poison and wormwood.
\verse And then when he hears the words of this oath, then \textit{he will assure himself} in his heart, \textit{saying}, ‘\textit{Safety shall be mine even though I go in the stubbornness of my heart},’ thereby destroying the well-watered land along with the parched.
\verse Adonai will not be willing to forgive him, for by then the anger of Adonai will smoke, and his passion against that man and all the curses written in this scroll will descend on him, and Adonai will blot out his name from under heaven.
\verse And Adonai will single him out for calamity out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant written in the scroll of this law.
\verse “And the next generation, that is, your children who will rise up after you, and the foreigner who will come from a distant land, when they will see the plagues of that land and its diseases that Adonai has inflicted upon it, will say,
\verse ‘All its land is brimstone and salt left by fire, \textit{none of its land will be sown}, and it will not make plants sprout out and it will not grow any vegetation; it is as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Adman and Zeboiim, which Adonai overturned in his anger and in his wrath.’
\verse And all the nations will say, ‘\textit{Why} has Adonai done \textit{such a thing} to this land? What caused the fierceness of this great anger?’
\verse And they will say, ‘It is because they abandoned the covenant of Adonai, the God of their ancestors, which he \textit{made} with them \textit{when he brought them out} from the land of Egypt.
\verse And they went and served other gods and bowed down to them, gods whom they did not know them and he had not allotted to them.
\verse So \textit{the anger of Adonai was kindled} against that land to bring upon it all the curses written in this scroll,
\verse and Adonai uprooted them from their land in anger and in wrath and in great fury, and he cast them into another land, \textit{just as it is today}.’

\verse And Adonai your God will make you prosperous \textit{in all your undertakings}, and in the fruit of your livestock and in the fruit of your ground \textit{abundantly}, for Adonai \textit{will again rejoice} over you, just as he rejoiced over your ancestors.
\verse He will do this if you listen to the voice of Adonai your God by keeping his commandment and his statutes written in the scroll of this law and if you return to Adonai your God with all your heart and with all your inner self.
\verse “For this commandment that I am commanding you \textit{today} is \textit{not too wonderful for you}, and it is not too far from you.
\verse It is not in the heavens \textit{so that you might say}, ‘Who will go up for us to the heavens and get it for us and cause us to hear it, so that we may do it?’
\verse And it is \textit{not beyond the sea}, \textit{so that you might say}, ‘Who will cross for us to the other side of the sea and take it for us and cause us to hear it, so that we may do it?’
\verse But the word is very near you, even in your mouth and in your heart, \textit{so that you may do it}.
\verse “See, I am setting \textit{before you} \textit{today} life and prosperity and death and disaster;

\verse However, if your heart turns aside and you do not listen and you are lured away and you bow down to other gods and you serve them,
\verse I declare to you \textit{today} that you will certainly perish; \textit{you will not extend your time} on the land that you are crossing the Jordan to go there to take possession of it.
\verse I invoke as a witness against you \textit{today} the heaven and the earth: life and death I have set \textit{before you}, blessing and curse. So choose life, so that you may live, you and your offspring,

\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 31
\verseWithHeading{Succession, Deposition, and Recitation of Text} And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
\verse And he said to them, “I am a hundred and twenty years old \textit{today}; I am not able to go out and to come in any longer, and Adonai said to me, ‘You may not cross this Jordan.’
\verse Adonai your God is about to cross \textit{before you}; he will destroy these nations \textit{before you}, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua will be crossing \textit{before you}, just as Adonai \textit{promised}.
\verse And Adonai will do to them just as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and to their land, which he destroyed with them.
\verse And Adonai \textit{will deliver them to you before you}, and you shall do to them according to every commandment that I have commanded you.
\verse Be strong and be courageous; you should not be afraid, and you \textit{should not be in dread from their presence}, for Adonai your God is the one going with you; he will not leave you alone and he will not forsake you.”
\verse Then Moses summoned Joshua, and he said to him \textit{in the presence of all Israel}, “Be strong and be courageous, for you will go with this people into the land that Adonai swore to their ancestors to give to them, and you will give it to them as an inheritance.
\verse Adonai is the one going \textit{before you}; he will be with you, and he will not leave you alone, and he will not forsake you; you shall not be afraid, and you shall not be discouraged.”
\verse So Moses wrote this law, and he gave it to the priests, the descendants of Levi, the ones carrying the ark of the covenant of Adonai, and to all the elders of Israel.
\verse Then Moses commanded them, \textit{saying}, “At the end of seven years, in the time of the year for canceling debts during the Feast of Booths,
\verse \textit{when all Israel comes to appear before} Adonai their God at the place that he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel \textit{in their hearing}.
\verse Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little children and your aliens that are in your \textit{towns}, so that they may hear and so that they may learn and they may revere Adonai your God, and \textit{they shall diligently observe} all the words of this law.
\verse And then their children, who have not known, they too may hear, and they may learn to revere Adonai their God all the days \textit{that you live} on the land that you are crossing the Jordan \textit{to get there} to take possession of it.”
\verse Then Adonai said to Moses, “Look, \textit{you are about to die}; call Joshua and present yourselves in the tent of assembly, so that I may instruct him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tent of assembly.
\verse And Adonai appeared in the tent in a column of cloud, and the column of the cloud stood at the entrance of the tent.
\verse And Adonai said to Moses, “Look, you are about to lie down with your ancestors, and this people will arise and they will play the prostitute after \textit{the foreign gods} of the land \textit{to which they are going}.
\verse And \textit{my anger shall flare up against them} on that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall become as prey, and disasters and troubles shall find them, and they shall say on that day, ‘Is it not because our God is not in our midst that these disasters have found us?’
\verse But I will certainly hide my face on that day, because of all of the evil that they did because they turned to other gods.
\verse “And so then write this song for yourselves and teach it to the \textit{Israelites}; put it in their mouth, so that this song may be for me as a witness against the \textit{Israelites}.
\verse For when I bring them into the land that I swore to their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey, \textit{they will eat their fill}, and they will become fat, and then they will turn to other gods, and they will serve them, and they will spurn me, and they will break my covenant.
\verse \textit{And then} many disasters and troubles will come upon them, and this song will give evidence before them as a witness, because it will not be forgotten from out of the mouth of their descendants, for I know their inclination that they are having \textit{today} before I have brought them into the land that I swore.”
\verse And Moses wrote this song on that day and taught it to the \textit{Israelites}.
\verse Then he told Joshua the son of Nun, and said to him, “Be strong and be courageous, for you shall bring the \textit{Israelites} into the land that I swore to them, and I will be with you.”
\verse \textit{And then when Moses finished writing} the words of this law on the scroll \textit{until they were complete},
\verse then Moses commanded the Levites carrying the ark of the covenant of Adonai, \textit{saying},
\verse “Take the scroll of this law and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of Adonai your God, and it will be there as a witness against you.
\verse For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck even now while I am still alive with you \textit{today}, rebelling against Adonai, and \textit{how much more} after my death.
\verse Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officials, so that I may speak in their ears these words, and that I may call as witness against them heaven and earth.
\verse For I know that after my death you will certainly act corruptly, and you will turn aside from the way that I have commanded you, and the disaster in the future days will befall you, because you will do evil in the eyes of Adonai, \textit{provoking him with the work of your hands}.”
\verse So Moses spoke into the ears of the assembly of Israel the words of this song \textit{until they were complete}.

\verse For I will proclaim the name of Adonai; 
ascribe greatness to our God!
\verse The Rock, his work is perfect, 
for all his ways are just; 
he is a faithful God, and \textit{without injustice}; 
righteous and upright is he.
\verse They have behaved corruptly toward him; 
they are not his children; this is their flaw, 
a generation crooked and perverse.
\verse Like this do you treat Adonai, 
foolish and \textit{unwise} people? 
Has he not, your father, created you? 
He made you, and he established you.
\verse Remember the old days, \textit{the years long past}; 
ask your father, and he will inform you, 
your elders and they will tell you.
\verse \textit{When the Most High apportioned} the nations, 
at his dividing up of the sons of humankind, 
he fixed the boundaries of the peoples, 
according to the number of the children of Israel.
\verse For Adonai’s portion was his people, 
Jacob the share of his inheritance.
\verse He found him in a desert land, 
and in a howling, desert wasteland; 
he \textit{encircled him}, he cared for him, 
he protected him like the \textit{apple} of his eye.
\verse As an eagle stirs up its nest, 
hovers over its young, 
spreads out its wings, takes them, 
carries them on its pinions,
\verse so Adonai alone guided him, 
and \textit{there was no foreign god accompanying him}.
\verse And he set him on the high places of the land, 
and he fed him the crops of the field, 
and he nursed him with honey from crags, 
and with oil from flinty rock,
\verse With curds from the herd, 
and with milk from the flock, 
with the fat of young rams, 
and rams, the offspring of Bashan, 
and with goats along with the finest kernels of wheat, 
and from the blood of grapes you drank fermented wine.
\verse And Jeshurun grew fat, and he kicked; 
you grew fat, you bloated, and you became obstinate; 
and he abandoned God, his maker, 
and he scoffed at the rock of his salvation.
\verse They made him jealous with strange gods; 
with detestable things they provoked him.
\verse They sacrificed to the demons, not God, 
to gods whom they had not known, 
new gods who came from recent times; 
\textit{their ancestors had not known them}.
\verse The rock who bore you, you neglected, 
and you forgot God, the one giving you birth.
\verse Then Adonai saw, and he spurned them, 
because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.
\verse So he said, ‘I will hide my face from them; 
I will see what will be their end, 
for they are a generation of perversity, 
\textit{children in whom there is no faithfulness}.
\verse They annoyed me with what is not a god; 
they provoked me with their idols. 
So I will make them jealous with those not a people, 
with a foolish nation I will provoke them.
\verse For a fire was kindled by my anger, 
and it burned \textit{up to the depths of Sheol}, 
and it devoured the earth and its produce, 
and it set afire the foundation of the mountains.
\verse I will heap disasters upon them; 
my arrows I will spend on them.
\verse They will become weakened by famine, 
and consumed by plague and bitter pestilence; 
and the teeth of wild animals I will send against them, 
with the poison of the creeping things in the dust;
\verse From outside her boundaries the sword will make her childless, 
and from inside, terror; 
both for the young man and also the young woman, 
the infant along with the gray-headed man.
\verse I thought, “I will wipe them out; 
\textit{I will make people forget they ever existed}.”
\verse If I had not feared a provocation of the enemy, 
lest their foes might misunderstand,  
lest they should say,  “Our hand is 
\textit{triumphant}, and Adonai did not do all this.” ’
\verse For \textit{they are a nation void of sense}, 
and there is not any understanding in them.
\verse If only they were wise, they would understand this; 
they would discern \textit{for themselves their end}.
\verse How could one chase a thousand 
and two could cause a myriad to flee, 
if their Rock had not sold them, 
and Adonai had not given them up?
\verse For the fact of the matter is, 
their rock is not like our Rock, 
and our enemies recognize this.
\verse For their vine is from the vine of Sodom, 
and from the terraces of Gomorrah; 
their grapes are grapes of poison; 
\textit{their clusters are bitter}.
\verse Their wine is the poison of snakes, 
and the deadly poison of horned vipers.
\verse ‘Is not this stored up with me, 
sealed in my treasuries?’
\verse \textit{Vengeance belongs to me} and also recompense, 
\textit{for at the time their foot slips}, 
because the day of their disaster is near, 
\textit{and fate comes quickly for them}.’
\verse For Adonai will judge on behalf of his people, 
and concerning his servants; 
he will change his mind when he sees that their power has disappeared, 
and there is no one left, confined or free.
\verse And he will say, ‘Where are their gods, 
their rock in whom they took refuge?
\verse Who ate the fat of their sacrifices 
and drank the wine of their libations? 
Let them rise up, and let them help you; 
\textit{Let them be to you a refuge}.
\verse See, now, that I, even I am he, 
and there is not a god besides me; 
I put to death and I give life; 
I wound and I heal; 
there is not one who delivers from my hand!
\verse For indeed I lift up my hand to heaven, 
And I promise \textit{as I live forever},
\verse When I sharpen \textit{my flashing sword}, 
and my hand takes hold of it in judgment, 
\textit{I will take reprisals against my foes}, 
and my haters I will repay.
\verse I will make my arrows drunk with blood, 
and my sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain, 
and captives from the heads of the leaders of the enemy.’
\verse Call for songs of joy, O nations, concerning his people, 
for the blood of his servants he will avenge, 
\textit{and he will take reprisals against his foes}, 
and he will make atonement for his land, his people.”

\verse You shall die on that mountain that you are about to go up there, and you will be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on \textit{Mount Hor} and he was gathered to his people,
\verse because of the fact that you broke faith with me in the midst of Israel at the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the desert of Zin, because \textit{you did not treat me as holy} in the midst of the \textit{Israelites}.
\verse Yes, from afar you may view the land, but there you shall not enter there, that is, into the land that I am giving to the \textit{Israelites}.”

\verseWithHeading{Blessings of Moses on Israel} Now this is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the \textit{Israelites} \textit{before} his death.
\verse Then he said,
\verse “Adonai came from Sinai, 
and he dawned upon them from Seir; 
he shone forth from Mount Paran, 
and he came with myriads of holy ones, 
at his right hand a fiery law for them.
\verse Moreover, \textit{he loves his people}, 
all the holy ones were in your hand, 
and they bowed down to your feet, 
\textit{each one accepted directions from you}.
\verse A law Moses instructed for us, 
as a possession for the assembly of Jacob.
\verse And then a king arose in Jeshurun, 
at the gathering of the leaders of the people, 
\textit{united were the tribes of Israel}.
\verse “May Reuben live, and may he not die, 
\textit{and let his number not be few}.”
\verse \textit{And he said this of Judah}, 
“Hear, O Adonai, the voice of Judah, 
and bring him to his people; 
his own hands strive for him, 
and may you be a help \textit{against} his foes.”
\verse And of Levi he said, 
“Your Thummim and your Urim 
are for \textit{your faithful one}, 
\textit{whom you tested at Massah}; 
you contended with him 
at the waters of Meribah.
\verse The one saying of his father and of his mother, 
‘I have not regarded them,’ 
and his brothers he did not acknowledge, 
and his children he did not know, 
but rather they observed your word, 
and your covenant they kept.
\verse They taught your regulations to Jacob, 
and your law to Israel; 
they placed incense smoke \textit{before you}, 
and whole burnt offerings on your altar.
\verse Bless, O Adonai, his substance, 
and with the work of his hands you must be pleased; 
smite the loins of those who attack him, 
and those hating him, \textit{so that they cannot arise}.”
\verse Of Benjamin he said, 
“The beloved of Adonai dwells \textit{securely}, 
the Most High shields all around him, 
all the day, 
and between his shoulders he dwells.”
\verse And of Joseph he said, 
“Blessed by Adonai is his land, 
with the choice things of heaven, 
with dew, and with the deep lying down beneath,
\verse and with the choice things of the fruits of the the sun, 
and with the choice things of the yield of the \textit{seasons},
\verse and with the finest things of the ancient mountains, 
and with the choice things of the \textit{eternal hills},
\verse and with the choice things of the earth and its fullness, 
and the favor of the one \textit{who dwelt} in the bush. 
Let them come to the head of Joseph, 
and to the crown of the prince among his brothers.
\verse As the firstborn of his ox, majesty \textit{belongs to him}, 
and his horns are the horns of a wild ox; 
with them he drives people together, 
and they are the myriads of Ephraim, 
and they are the thousands of Manasseh.”
\verse And of Zebulun he said, 
“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, 
and rejoice, Issachar, in your tents;
\verse They summon people to the mountains; 
there they sacrifice the sacrifices of righteousness, 
because the affluence of the seas they suck out, 
and \textit{the most hidden treasures of the sand}.”
\verse And of Gad he said, 
“Blessed be \textit{the one who enlarges Gad}; 
like a lion he dwells, 
and he tears an arm as well as a scalp.
\verse And he selected the best part for himself,  
for there the portion of a ruler is included, 
and he came with the heads of the people; 
he did the righteousness of Adonai, 
and his regulations for Israel.”
\verse And of Dan he said, 
“Dan is a cub of a lion; 
he leaps from Bashan.”
\verse And of Naphtali, he said, 
“Oh, Naphtali, sated of favor, 
and full of the blessing of Adonai; 
take possession of the lake, 
and the land to the south.”
\verse And of Asher he said, 
“Blessed \textit{more than sons} is Asher; 
\textit{may he be the favorite} of his brothers, 
\textit{dipping his feet in the oil}.
\verse Your bars are iron and bronze, 
and as your days, so is your strength.”
\verse “There is no one like God, O, Jeshurun, 
who rides through the heavens to your help, 
and with his majesty through the skies.
\verse The God of \textit{ancient time} is a hiding place, 
and underneath are the arms of eternity, 
and he drove out \textit{from before} you your enemy, 
and he said, ‘Destroy them!’
\verse So Israel dwells alone and carefree, 
the spring of Jacob in a land of grain and wine; 
his heavens even drip dew.

\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 34
\verseWithHeading{The Death of Moses and the Commissioning of Joshua} Then Moses went up from the desert plateau of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, \textit{which is opposite} Jericho, and Adonai showed him all of the land, Gilead all the way up to Dan,
\verse and all of Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh and all of the land of Judah, up to the western sea,
\verse and the Negev and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palms, on up to Zoar.
\verse And Adonai said to him, “This is the land that I swore to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob, \textit{saying}, ‘To your offspring I will give it.’ I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross \textit{into it}.”
\verse Then Moses, the servant of Adonai, died there in the land of Moab \textit{according to the command of Adonai}.
\verse And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth Peor. But until this day no one knows his burial site.
\verse \textit{Now Moses was a hundred and twenty years old} \textit{when he died}; \textit{his sight was not impaired and his vigor had not abated}.
\verse And the \textit{Israelites} wept concerning Moses thirty days; finally the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were completed.
\verse Now Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom because Moses had placed his hands on him, and the \textit{Israelites} listened to him, and they did as Adonai had commanded Moses.
\verse And not again has a prophet arisen in Israel like Moses, whom Adonai knew face to face,
\verse as far as all the signs and the wonders Adonai sent him to do in the land of Egypt, against Pharaoh and all of his servants and against all of his land,
\verse and as far as all of \textit{the mighty deeds} and as far as \textit{the great awesome wonders} Moses did before the eyes of all Israel.
