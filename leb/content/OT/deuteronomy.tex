\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 1
\verseWithHeading{Preamble} These \textit{are} the words that Moses spoke to all \textit{of} Israel \textit{on the other side of} the Jordan in the desert, in the desert plateau opposite Suph, between Paran and between Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab.
\verse It is \textit{a journey of} \textit{eleven days} from Herob \textit{by the way of Mount Seir} up to Kadesh Barnea.
\verse \textit{And it was} in the fortieth year, on the eleventh month, on \textit{the} first \textit{day} of the month, Moses spoke to the \textit{Israelites} according to all that Adonai had instructed him \textit{to speak} to them.
\verse \textit{This happened} \textit{after defeating} Sihon king of the Amorites, who \textit{was} reigning in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who \textit{was} reigning in Ashtaroth in Edrei.
\verse On the other side of  the Jordan in the land of Moab Moses began to explain this law, \textit{saying}:
\verseWithHeading{Historical Prologue} “Adonai our God spoke to us at Horeb, \textit{saying}, ‘You have stayed \textit{long enough} at this mountain.
\verse Turn \textit{now} and \textit{move on}, and go \textit{into} the hill of the Amorites and to all \textit{of} the neighboring regions in the Jordan \textit{Valley} in the hill country and in the Negev and in the coastal area along the sea, \textit{into} the land of the Canaanites and \textit{into} the Lebanon, as far as the great river Euphrates.
\verse Look, I have set the land \textit{before you}; go and take possession of the land that Adonai swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give \textit{it} to them and to their offspring after them.’
\verse “And I spoke to them at that time, \textit{saying}, ‘I am not able to bear you alone.
\verse Adonai your God has multiplied you, and look; you \textit{are} today as the stars of the heaven \textit{in number}.
\verse Adonai, the God of your ancestors, may he add to you as you are \textit{now} a thousand times, and may he bless you just as he \textit{promised you}.
\verse How can I bear you \textit{by myself}, your burden and your load and your strife?
\verse Choose for yourselves \textit{wise and discerning and knowledgeable men} for \textit{each of} your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.’
\verse “And you answered me, and you said, ‘The thing you have said to do is good.’
\verse And so I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and \textit{then} I appointed them as leaders over you \textit{as} commanders of \textit{groups of} thousands and commanders of \textit{groups of} hundreds and commanders of \textit{groups of} fifties and commanders of \textit{groups of} tens \textit{as} officials for your tribes.
\verse And at that time I instructed your judges, saying, ‘\textit{hear out your fellow men}, and \textit{then} judge fairly between a man and between his brother and between \textit{his opponent who is a resident alien}.
\verse You must not \textit{be partial} \textit{in your judgment};  hear \textit{out} the small \textit{person} as \textit{also} the great \textit{person}; \textit{do not be intimidated by any person}, because the judgment \textit{is} God’s; and the case that is too difficult for you, bring \textit{it} to me, and I will hear it \textit{out}.’
\verse And so I instructed you at that time \textit{concerning} all \textit{of} the things that you should do.
\verse “Then we set out from Horeb, and we went \textit{through} the whole \textit{of} that great and terrible desert that you saw \textit{on} the way \textit{to} the hill country of the Amorites as Adonai our God had commanded us, and \textit{so} we came up to Kadesh Barnea.
\verse I said to you, ‘\textit{You have reached} the hill country of the Amorites that Adonai our God \textit{is} giving to us.
\verse See, Adonai your God has set before you the land; go up and possess \textit{it} as Adonai the God of your ancestors said to you; do not fear and do not be dismayed.’
\verse “Then all of you approached me, and \textit{you} said, ‘Let us send men \textit{before us}, and let them explore the land for us, and let them bring back \textit{a report} to us \textit{concerning} the way that \textit{we should take} \textit{and concerning} the cities that we shall come to.’
\verse The plan was good \textit{in my opinion}, and \textit{so} I took from \textit{among} you twelve men, \textit{one from each tribe}.
\verse And they \textit{set out} and \textit{went up into the hill country}, and they went up to the wadi of Eschol, and they spied out \textit{the land}.
\verse They took in their hands \textit{some of the fruit} of the land, and they brought \textit{it} down to us, and they brought to us back \textit{a report}, and they said, ‘The land that Adonai our God \textit{is} giving to us \textit{is} good.’
\verse But you were not willing to go up, and you rebelled against the \textit{command} of Adonai your God.
\verse And you grumbled in your tents, and you said, ‘Because of the hatred of Adonai \textit{toward} us he has brought us out from the land of Egypt to give us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.
\verse Where \textit{can} we go up? Our brothers have \textit{made our hearts melt}, \textit{saying}, “The people are greater and taller than we are, \textit{and there are} great fortified cities \textit{reaching} up to heaven, and we saw the sons of the Anakites \textit{living} there.” ’
\verse “And so I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified, and do not fear them.
\verse Adonai your God, who is going \textit{before you}, will himself fight for you, \textit{just as} he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
\verse and \textit{just as he did} in the wilderness when you saw that Adonai your God carried you, just as someone carries his son, all \textit{along} the way \textit{that} you traveled until \textit{you reached} this place.’
\verse But through all of this you did not trust in Adonai your God,
\verse \textit{who goes} \textit{before you} on your way, seeking a place for your encampment, in fire at night and in a cloud by day, to show you the way that \textit{you should go}.
\verse “Then Adonai heard the sound of your words, and he was angry, and he swore, \textit{saying},
\verse ‘No one of these men of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors,
\verse except Caleb, the son of Jephunneh; he himself shall see it, and to him I will give the land upon which he has trodden and to his sons because \textit{he followed Adonai unreservedly}.’
\verse Even with me Adonai was angry because of you, saying, ‘Not even you shall enter there.
\verse Joshua, the son of Nun, \textit{your assistant}, will go there; encourage him because he will cause Israel to inherit it.
\verse And your little children, who you thought shall become plunder, and your sons, who do not today know good or bad, shall themselves go there, and I will give it to them, and they shall take possession of it.
\verse But you turn and set out \textit{in the direction of} the wilderness by way of the \textit{Red Sea}.’
\verse “You replied and said to me, ‘We have sinned against Adonai, \textit{and now} we will go up and fight according to all that Adonai our God commanded us’; and \textit{so} each man fastened on \textit{his battle gear}, and you regarded \textit{it} as easy to go up \textit{into} the hill country.
\verse So Adonai said to me, ‘Say to them, “You shall not go up, and you shall not fight because I am not in your midst; you will be defeated \textit{before} your enemies.” ’
\verse So I spoke to you, but you did not listen; you rebelled against the \textit{command of Adonai}; you behaved presumptuously, and you went up into the hill country.
\verse The Amorites living in the hill country went out \textit{to oppose you} and chased you as \textit{a swarm of} wild honey bees do; and \textit{so} they \textit{beat} you down in Seir as far as Hormah.
\verse So you returned and wept \textit{before Adonai}; but Adonai did not listen to your voice and did not pay \textit{any} attention to you.
\verse You stayed in Kadesh many days; such were the days that you stayed \textit{there}.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 2
\verse “\textit{Then} we turned and set out \textit{toward} the wilderness in the direction of the \textit{Red Sea}, as Adonai told me, and we went around Mount Seir \textit{for} many days.
\verse Adonai spoke to me, \textit{saying},
\verse ‘\textit{Long} enough you have been skirting this mountain; turn yourselves north,
\verse and instruct the people, \textit{saying}, “You \textit{are} about to cross \textit{through} the territory of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who are living in Seir; they will be afraid of you, and \textit{so} be very careful.
\verse Do not get involved in battle with them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even \textit{a foot’s breadth} \textit{of it}; since I have given Mount Seir \textit{as} a possession for Esau.
\verse You shall buy food from them so that you may eat; and also you shall purchase water from them with money so that you may drink.
\verse The fact of the matter is, Adonai your God has blessed you in \textit{all the work you have done}; he knows \textit{your travels} \textit{with respect to} this great wilderness; forty years Adonai your God \textit{has been} with you; you have not lacked a thing.” ’
\verse And so we passed by our brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, past the road of the Arabah, from Elath and Ezion Geber, and we turned and traveled along the route of the desert of Moab.
\verse And Adonai said to me, ‘You shall not attack Moab, and you shall not engage in war with them, for I will not give you any of his land \textit{as} a possession; I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot \textit{as} a possession.’
\verse (The Emim previously lived in it, a people large, numerous, and tall, like the Anakites.
\verse They were reckoned also \textit{as} Rephaim as the Anakites \textit{were}; but the Moabites called them Emim.
\verse The Horites previously lived in Seir, but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them \textit{from among themselves}, as Israel did with respect to the land of their possession that Adonai gave to them.)
\verse So \textit{now} arise and cross over the wadi of Zered yourselves; and \textit{so} we crossed the wadi of Zered.
\verse Now the \textit{length of time} that we had traveled from Kadesh Barnea until \textit{the time when} we crossed the wadi of Zered \textit{was} thirty-eight years, until the perishing of all of that generation; \textit{that is}, the men of war from the midst of the camp as Adonai had sworn to them.
\verse The hand of Adonai was against them to root them out from the midst of the camp until they perished completely.
\verse “\textit{And then} when all the men of war \textit{had died} from among the people,
\verse Adonai spoke to me, \textit{saying},
\verse ‘You \textit{are} about to cross over the boundary of Moab \textit{today} at Ar.
\verse When you approach \textit{the border of} the \textit{Ammonites}, you shall not harass them, and you shall not get involved in battle with them, for I have not given the land of \textit{the Ammonites} to you as a possession; because I have given it to the descendants of Lot \textit{as} a possession.
\verse (It is also considered the land of Rephaim; Rephaim lived in it \textit{previously}, and the Ammonites called them Zamzummim,
\verse a people great and numerous and as tall as the Anakites; Adonai destroyed them from before them, and they dispossessed them and settled in place of them,
\verse just as he did for the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from \textit{before them} and dispossessed them, and \textit{then} they settled in their place up to this day.
\verse And \textit{also} the Avvites, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, \textit{and the} Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, destroyed them and \textit{then} settled in their place.
\verse Arise, set out and cross \textit{over} the wadi of Arnon. Look! I have given Sihon the Amorite, the king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand; begin to take possession of \textit{it}, and engage with him in battle.
\verse This day I will begin to place \textit{the dread of you} and the fear of you \textit{before} the peoples under all the heavens. \textit{They} will hear \textit{the report about you}, and \textit{so} they will shake and tremble \textit{because of you}.’ 
\verse “So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon; \textit{I sent} terms of peace, \textit{saying},
\verse ‘Let me cross through your land \textit{and} \textit{only along the road} I will go; I will not turn aside to the right or \textit{to the} left.
\verse Food for money you shall sell me, so that I may eat, and water for money you will give to me, so that I may drink; just let me cross on foot.
\verse \textit{Just as} the descendants of Esau did for me, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, until I cross the Jordan into the land that Adonai our God is giving to us.’
\verse But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing to let us cross through his \textit{territory} because Adonai your God hardened his spirit and \textit{made him obstinate} \textit{in order to give him} into your hand, \textit{just as he has now done}.
\verse Adonai said to me, ‘Look! I have begun to give \textit{over to you} Sihon and his land; begin \textit{to take possession of his land}.’
\verse Then Sihon and all his people came out to meet us for battle at Jahaz.
\verse And so Adonai our God gave him over \textit{to us}, and we struck him down, and his sons and all of his people.
\verse So we captured all of his cities at that time, and we destroyed each town \textit{of} males and the women and the children; we did not leave behind a survivor.
\verse We took only the livestock as spoil for ourselves, and \textit{also} the booty of the cities that we had captured.
\verse From Aroer, which \textit{is} on the edge of the wadi of Arnon and the city that \textit{was} in the wadi on up to Gilead, \textit{there} was not a city that was inaccessible to us; Adonai our God gave \textit{everything} \textit{to us}.
\verse Only the land of \textit{the Ammonites} you did not approach, \textit{all along} the whole upper region of the Jabbok \textit{River} and the towns of the hill country, \textit{according to all} that Adonai our God had instructed.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 3
\verse “Then we turned, and we went up the road to Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us, he and all \textit{of} his army for the battle \textit{at} Edrei.
\verse And Adonai said to me, ‘You should not fear him, for I have given him and all \textit{of} his army and his land into your hand. And \textit{so} you will do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who \textit{was} reigning in Heshbon.’
\verse And \textit{so} Adonai our God also gave Og the king of Bashan, and all of his army into our hand, and we struck him down until not a survivor remained to him.
\verse And we captured all \textit{of} his towns at that time; \textit{there} was not a city that we did not take from them.
\verse All of these \textit{were} fortified towns with high walls, gates, and bars, \textit{apart from} very many \textit{of} the villages of the open country.
\verse And \textit{so} we destroyed them just as we had done to Sihon the king of Heshbon; \textit{we destroyed} utterly each town of males, the women, and the little children.
\verse But all \textit{of} the livestock and the booty of the towns we kept as spoil for ourselves.
\verse “And so we took at that time the land from \textit{the control of} \textit{the} two kings of the Amorites who \textit{were} \textit{on the other side of the Jordan}, from the wadi of Arnon up to \textit{Mount Hermon}.
\verse (The Sidonians called Hermon ‘Sirion,’ and the Amorites called it ‘Senir.’)
\verse All of the towns of the plateau and the whole of Gilead and all of Bashan up to Salecah and Edrei, the towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\verse (For only Og, king of Bashan, was left from the remnant of the Rephaim. Indeed, his bedstead—it \textit{was} a bedstead of iron. It is in Rabbah of the \textit{Ammonites}. Nine cubits \textit{is} its length, and four cubits \textit{is} its width according to the cubit of a man.)
\verse And \textit{so} we took possession of this land at that time, from Aroer, which \textit{is} on the \textit{edge of the} wadi of Arnon, and \textit{also} half of the hill country of Gilead and its towns I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
\verse And the remainder of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the whole region of Argo. All of that \textit{area of} Bashan was called \textit{the} land of the Rephaim.
\verse Jair the descendant of Manasseh acquired the whole region of Argob, up to the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and he called it, \textit{that is} Bashan, after his \textit{own} name, Havvoth Jair, \textit{as it still is today}.
\verse And \textit{also} I gave Gilead to Makir.
\verse And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave, from Gilead up to the wadi of Arnon, the middle of the wadi \textit{as a} boundary and up to the Jabbok \textit{River}, the boundary of the \textit{Ammonites}.
\verse And the \textit{Jordan Valley} \textit{with} the Jordan \textit{River as its} boundary, from Kinnereth up to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, \textit{with} the slopes of Pisgah toward the east.
\verse “And I charged you \textit{all} at that time \textit{when I} said, “Adonai has given you—to \textit{all of} you—this land to possess. All the \textit{warriors} shall cross over, ready to fight, before your brothers, the \textit{Israelites}.
\verse Only your wives and your little children and your livestock (I know that \textit{you have much livestock}) must stay in your towns that I have given you,
\verse until Adonai shall give rest to your brothers as \textit{he did} to you, and also they take possession \textit{of} the land that Adonai your God \textit{is} giving to them beyond the Jordan; then they may return, each \textit{one} to his possession that I have given to them.
\verse And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes see all that Adonai your God has done to these two kings; so Adonai will do to all \textit{of} the kingdoms where you are about to cross over to.
\verse You shall not fear them, for Adonai your God is the \textit{one} fighting for you.
\verse “And I pleaded with Adonai at that time, saying,
\verse ‘Lord Adonai, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your strong hand, for what god \textit{is there} in the heaven or on the earth who can do according to your works and according to your mighty deeds?
\verse Let me cross over, please, and let me see the good land \textit{that is beyond the Jordan}, this good hill country and Lebanon.’
\verse But Adonai was very angry with me because of you, and he would not listen to me, and Adonai said, ‘\textit{Enough of that from you}! You shall not speak to me \textit{any} longer about this matter!
\verse Go up \textit{to} the top of Pisgah and \textit{look around you} toward the west, toward the north, and toward the east, and \textit{view} \textit{the land} with your eyes, for you will not cross this Jordan.
\verse Now instruct Joshua and support him and encourage him because he himself will cross \textit{over} before this people and enable them to inherit the land that you will see.’
\verse So we remained in the valley opposite Beth Peor.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 4
\verseWithHeading{Introduction to the Stipulations} “Now, Israel, listen to the rules and to the regulations that I \textit{am} teaching you to do, in order that you may live and you may go \textit{in} and you may take possession of the land that Adonai, the God of your ancestors, \textit{is} giving to you.
\verse You must not add to the word that I \textit{am} commanding you, and you shall not take away from it \textit{in order} to keep the commands of Adonai your God that I \textit{am} commanding you \textit{to observe}.
\verse Your eyes have seen what Adonai did with \textit{the case of} Baal Peor, for \textit{each} man that followed after Baal Peor Adonai your God destroyed from your midst.
\verse But you, the \textit{ones} holding fast to Adonai your God, \textit{are} all alive \textit{today}.
\verse See, I now teach you rules and regulations \textit{just} as Adonai my God has commanded me, to observe \textit{them} \textit{just} so in the midst of the land where you \textit{are} going, to take possession of it.
\verse And \textit{you must observe them diligently}, for that \textit{is} your wisdom and your insight before the eyes of the people, who will hear all \textit{of} these rules, and they will say, ‘Surely this great nation \textit{is} a wise and discerning people.’
\verse For what great nation \textit{has} for it a god near to it as Adonai our God, whenever we call \textit{upon} him?
\verse And what \textit{other} great nation has for it just rules and regulations just like \textit{this whole} law that I \textit{am} setting \textit{before} you \textit{today}?
\verse “However, \textit{take care} for yourself and watch your inner self closely, so that you do not forget the things that your eyes have seen, so that they do not slip from your mind all the days of your life; and you shall make them known to your children and to \textit{your grandchildren}.
\verse \textit{Remember} the day that you stood \textit{before} Adonai your God at Horeb \textit{when Adonai said to me}, ‘Summon for me the people so that I can tell them my words, that they may learn to fear me all \textit{of} the days they \textit{are} alive on the earth and so \textit{that} they may teach their children.’
\verse And \textit{so} you came near, and you stood under the mountain, and the mountain \textit{was} burning with fire up to the heart of the heaven, \textit{dark with a very thick cloud}.
\verse And Adonai spoke to you from the midst of the fire; \textit{you heard} a sound of words, but \textit{you did not see} a form—only a voice.
\verse And he declared to you his covenant, \textit{the Ten Commandments}, which he charged you \textit{to observe}, and he wrote them on \textit{the} two tablets of stone.
\verse And Adonai charged me at that time to teach you rules and regulations \textit{for your observation of them} in the land that you \textit{are} \textit{about to cross into} to take possession of it.
\verse “So \textit{you must be very careful for yourselves}, because you did not see any form on the day Adonai spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire,
\verse so that you \textit{do} not \textit{ruin yourselves} and make for yourselves a divine image \textit{in} a form of any image, a replica of male or female,
\verse a replica of any animal that \textit{is} upon the earth, a replica of any winged bird that flies in the air,
\verse a replica of any creeping thing on the ground, a replica of any fish that \textit{is} in the water \textit{below} the earth.
\verse \textit{And do this so that you do not lift} your eyes \textit{toward} heaven and \textit{observe} the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of the heaven, and be led astray and bow down to them and serve them, things that Adonai your God has allotted to all \textit{of} the peoples under all \textit{of} the heaven.
\verse But Adonai has taken you and brought you out from the furnace of iron, from Egypt, to be a people of inheritance to him, \textit{as it is this day}.
\verse “And Adonai was angry with me \textit{because of you}, and he swore \textit{that I would not cross the Jordan} and \textit{that I would not go to the good land} that Adonai your God is giving you as an inheritance.
\verse For I \textit{am} going to die in this land; I am not going to cross the Jordan, but you \textit{are} going to cross, and you are going to take possession of this good land.
\verse Watch \textit{out} for yourselves so that you do not forget the covenant of Adonai your God that he had \textit{made} with you and make for yourselves a divine image \textit{of} the form of anything that Adonai your God \textit{has forbidden},
\verse for Adonai your God \textit{is} a devouring fire, a jealous God.
\verse “When you have had children and \textit{grandchildren} and you have grown old in the land and you act corruptly and you make a divine image \textit{of} the form of anything and you do evil in the eyes of Adonai your God, \textit{thus} provoking him to anger,
\verse I call to witness against you today the heaven and the earth, that you will perish soon and completely from the land that you \textit{are} crossing the Jordan into it to take possession of it; \textit{you will not live long on it}, but you will be completely destroyed.
\verse And Adonai will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left \textit{few in number} among the nations \textit{to where Adonai will lead you}.
\verse And you will there serve gods \textit{made by human hands}, \textit{of} wood and stone, \textit{gods} that cannot see and cannot hear and cannot eat and cannot smell.
\verse But from there you shall seek Adonai your God and will find him, if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul.
\verse \textit{In your distress} when all these things have found you in the \textit{latter days}, then you will return to Adonai your God, and you will listen to his voice.
\verse For Adonai your God is a compassionate God; he \textit{will not abandon you}, and he will not destroy you, and he will not forget the covenant of your ancestors that he swore to them.
\verse “Yes, ask, please, about former days that \textit{preceded you} from the day that God created humankind on the earth; \textit{ask even} from \textit{one} end of the heaven up to the \textit{other} end of heaven \textit{whether anything ever happened} like this great thing or \textit{whether anything like it was ever heard}.
\verse Has a people \textit{ever} heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, \textit{just} as you heard \textit{it}, and lived?
\verse Or has a god \textit{ever} attempted to go to take for himself a nation from the midst of a nation, \textit{using} trials and signs and wonders and war, with an outstretched arm and with great and awesome deeds, like all that Adonai your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
\verse You \textit{yourselves} were shown \textit{this wonder} in order \textit{for you} to acknowledge that Adonai \textit{is} the God; there is no other \textit{God} \textit{besides him}.
\verse From heaven he made you hear his voice to teach you, and on the earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from the midst of the fire.
\verse And because he loved your ancestors he chose their \textit{descendants} after them. And he brought you forth from Egypt \textit{with his own presence}, by his great strength,
\verse to drive out nations greater and more numerous than you \textit{from before you}, to bring you \textit{and} to give to you their land \textit{as} an inheritance, as \textit{it is} this day.
\verse So you shall acknowledge \textit{today}, and \textit{you must call to mind} that Adonai \textit{is} God in heaven above and on the earth beneath. There is no other \textit{God}.
\verse And you shall keep his rules and his commandments that I am commanding you \textit{today}, \textit{so} that \textit{it may go well} for you and for your children after you, and so that \textit{you may remain a long time} on the land that Adonai your God \textit{is} giving to you \textit{during} all \textit{of} those days.”
\verse Then Moses set apart three cities \textit{on the other side of the Jordan}, \textit{toward the east},
\verse \textit{in order for} \textit{a manslayer} to flee there \textit{who} has killed his neighbor \textit{without intent} and was not hating him \textit{previously}, and \textit{so} he could flee to one of these cities \textit{and be safe}.
\verse \textit{He set apart} Bezer in the wilderness in the land of the plateau of the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead of the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan of the Manassites.
\verse Now this \textit{is} the law that Moses set \textit{before} the \textit{Israelites};
\verse these are the legal provisions and the rules and the regulations that Moses spoke to the \textit{Israelites} \textit{when they left Egypt},
\verse beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth Peor in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who \textit{was} reigning in Heshbon \textit{and} whom Moses and the \textit{Israelites} defeated \textit{when they came out of Egypt}.
\verse And \textit{so} they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites who \textit{were} beyond the Jordan, \textit{eastward},
\verse from Aroer, which \textit{is} on the bank of the wadi of Arnon and as far as Mount Sirion; that \textit{is}, Hermon,
\verse and all \textit{of} the Arabah beyond the Jordan, eastward, and as far as the Sea of the Arabah under the slopes of Pisgah.

\verse I was standing \textit{between Adonai and you} at that time to report to you the word of Adonai, for you were afraid because of \textit{the presence of} the fire, and \textit{so} you \textit{did} not go up the mountain. \textit{He said},
\verse ‘I \textit{am} Adonai your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery.
\verse \textit{There} shall not be for you other gods \textit{besides me}.
\verse ‘You shall not make for yourself a divine image of any \textit{type} of form that \textit{is} in the heaven above or that \textit{is} on the earth beneath or that \textit{is} in the water under the earth.
\verse ‘You shall not bow down to them, and you shall not serve them, for I, Adonai your God, \textit{am} a jealous God, punishing the guilt of fathers upon \textit{their} children and upon \textit{the} third and upon \textit{the} fourth generation of \textit{those} hating me,
\verse but showing loyal love to thousands of \textit{those who} love me and of \textit{those who} keep my commandments.
\verse ‘You shall not take up the name of Adonai your God for \textit{a} worthless purpose, for Adonai will not leave unpunished \textit{anyone} who uses his name for \textit{a} worthless purpose.
\verse ‘Observe the \textit{Sabbath day} to make it holy, \textit{just} as Adonai your God has commanded you.
\verse Six days you shall work, and you shall do all \textit{of} your work,
\verse but the seventh day \textit{is} \textit{a} Sabbath unto Adonai your God; you shall not do any work, or your son, or your daughter, or your slave, or your slave woman, or your ox, or your donkey, or any of your domestic animals, or your \textit{resident} alien who \textit{is} in your \textit{towns}, so that your slave and your slave woman may rest as you \textit{rest}.
\verse And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Adonai your God brought you out with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm; therefore, Adonai your God commanded you to keep \textit{the Sabbath}.
\verse ‘Honor your father and your mother, as Adonai your God commanded you, so that it will be good for you \textit{in the land} that Adonai your God \textit{is} giving to you.

\verse ‘And you shall not commit adultery.
\verse ‘And you shall not steal.
\verse ‘And you shall not falsely bear evidence against your neighbor.
\verse ‘And you shall not covet the wife of your neighbor, and you shall not crave the house of your neighbor, his field or his slave or his slave woman or his ox and his donkey or anything \textit{that belongs to your neighbor}.’
\verse “These words Adonai spoke to your whole assembly at the mountain from the midst of the fire and the very thick cloud \textit{with} a loud voice, and \textit{he did not add anything}, and \textit{then} he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.
\verse \textit{And then} \textit{when you heard} the voice from the midst of the darkness, and \textit{as} the mountain \textit{was} burning with fire, and \textit{and} all the heads of your tribes and your elders approached me,
\verse you said, ‘Look, Adonai our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire; this day we have seen that God can speak with a human being, \textit{yet he remains alive}.
\verse And so then why shall we die, for this great fire will consume us if \textit{we continue} to hear the voice of Adonai our God \textit{any} longer, and \textit{so} we shall die?
\verse For who \textit{is there of} all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire as we \textit{have heard it} \textit{and remained alive}?
\verse \textit{You} go near and hear \textit{everything} that Adonai our God will say; and \textit{then} you tell us all that Adonai our God tells you, and we will listen, and we will do \textit{it}.’
\verse “And Adonai heard the sound of your words \textit{when you spoke to me}, and Adonai said to me, ‘I have heard the sound of the words of this people that they have spoken to you; \textit{they} are right \textit{with respect to} all that they have spoken.
\verse \textit{If only} \textit{they had such a mind}’; \textit{that is}, to fear me and to keep all my commandments \textit{at all times}, so that \textit{it will go well} for them and for their children \textit{forever}.
\verse Go! Say to them, “Return to your tents.”
\verse But you stand here with me, and let me tell you all \textit{of} the commandments and the rules and the regulations that you shall teach them, so that they may do \textit{them} in the land that I \textit{am} giving to them to take possession of it.’
\verse “\textit{So} you must be careful to do \textit{just} as Adonai your God commanded you; you shall not turn \textit{to the} right or \textit{to the} left.
\verse \textit{In exactly the path} that Adonai your God has commanded, you must go, so that you may live and \textit{it will go well} for you and \textit{you may live long} in the land that you will take possession of.”

\verse And you shall not intermarry with them; you shall not give your daughter to their son; and you shall not take his daughter for your son.
\verse For their sons and daughters will cause your son to turn away \textit{from following me}, and \textit{so} they will serve other gods, and \textit{the anger of Adonai would be kindled} against you, and he would quickly destroy you.
\verse But this is what you must do to them: you shall break down their altars, and their stone pillars you shall smash, and their Asherah poles you shall hew down, and you shall burn their idols with fire.
\verse For you \textit{are} a holy people for Adonai your God; Adonai your God has chosen you to be for him a people, a treasured possession from \textit{among} all the peoples that \textit{are} on the face of the earth.

\verse And he humbled you and let you go hungry, and \textit{then} he fed you with that which you did not know nor did your ancestors know, in order to make you know that not by bread alone but by all \textit{that} goes out of the mouth of Adonai humankind shall live.

\verse And Adonai spoke to me, \textit{saying}, ‘I have seen this people, and look! \textit{They are a stubborn people}.
\verse Leave me alone, and let me destroy them, and let me blot out their name from under heaven, and let me make you into a nation mightier and more numerous than they!’
\verse “And I turned, and I went down the mountain, as the mountain was burning with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant \textit{were} in my two hands.
\verse And I looked, and indeed you had sinned against Adonai your God; you \textit{had} made for yourselves an image of a calf \textit{of} cast metal;  you \textit{had} turned quickly from the way that Adonai had commanded \textit{for} you.
\verse And I took hold of the two tablets, and I threw them out \textit{of} my two hands and smashed them before your eyes.
\verse And \textit{then} I lay prostrate \textit{before} Adonai, as earlier, forty days and forty nights; I did not eat food and I did not drink water because of all your sins that you committed, by doing evil in the eyes of Adonai \textit{and so} provoking him.
\verse For \textit{I was in dread} from \textit{being in} the presence of the anger and the wrath \textit{with} which Adonai was angry with you \textit{so as} to destroy you, but Adonai listened to me also \textit{at that time}.
\verse And with Aaron Adonai was \textit{angry enough} to destroy him, and I prayed also for Aaron at that time.
\verse And your sinful thing that you had made, the molten calf, I took and I burned it with fire, and I crushed it, grinding it thoroughly until it was crushed to dust, and I threw its dust into \textit{the stream that flowed down the mountain}.
\verse “And \textit{also} at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Adonai to anger.
\verse And when Adonai sent you \textit{out} from Kadesh Barnea, \textit{saying}, ‘Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you,’ you rebelled against the command of Adonai your God, and you did not believe him, and you did not listen to his voice.
\verse You have been rebellious toward Adonai \textit{from the day I have known you}.
\verse “And I lay prostrate before Adonai through forty days, and through forty nights I prostrated myself, because Adonai intended to kill you.
\verse And I prayed to Adonai, and I said, ‘Lord Adonai, you must not destroy your people and your inheritance whom you redeemed in your greatness, whom you brought out from Egypt with a strong hand.
\verse Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; you must not \textit{pay attention to} the stubbornness of this people, to their wickedness and to their sin,
\verse lest \textit{the people of} the land from which you brought us out from there say, “Because Adonai was not able to bring them to the land that he \textit{promised} to them and because of his hatred \textit{toward} them, he has brought them out to kill them in the desert.”

\verse And Moses summoned all of Israel and said to them, “You saw all that Adonai did before your eyes in the land of Egypt and to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land;
\verse \textit{that is}, the great trials that your eyes saw, \textit{and} those great signs and wonders.

\verse And you have seen their detestable things and their idols of wood and stone, silver, and gold that \textit{were} among them,
\verse so that \textit{there is not} among you a man or a woman or a clan or a tribe \textit{whose heart} turns \textit{today} from \textit{being} with Adonai our God to go to serve the gods of these nations, so that there is not among you a root sprouting poison and wormwood.

\verse ‘All its land is brimstone and salt left by fire, \textit{none of its land will be sown}, and it will not make plants sprout out and it will not grow any vegetation; \textit{it is} as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Adman and Zeboiim, which Adonai overturned in his anger and in his wrath.’
\verse And all the nations will say, ‘\textit{Why} has Adonai done \textit{such a thing} to this land? What \textit{caused} the fierceness of this great anger?’

\verse And they went and served other gods and bowed down to them, gods whom they did not know them and he had not allotted to them.
\verse So \textit{the anger of Adonai was kindled} against that land to bring upon it all the curses written in this scroll,
\verse and Adonai uprooted them from their land in anger and in wrath and in great fury, and he cast them into another land, \textit{just as it is today}.’

\verse “And then when all of these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse that I have set \textit{before you} \textit{and you call them to mind} among the nations there where Adonai your God \textit{has} scattered you,
\verse and you return to Adonai and you listen to his voice according to all that I am commanding you \textit{today}, \textit{both} you and your children, with all your heart and with all your inner self,
\verse and Adonai your God will restore your fortunes, and he will have compassion \textit{upon} you, and \textit{he will again gather you together} from all the peoples where Adonai your God scattered you there.
\verse “\textit{Even} if \textit{you are outcasts} at the end of the heavens, \textit{even} from there Adonai your God shall gather you, and from there \textit{he shall bring you back}.
\verse And Adonai your God will bring you to the land that your ancestors had taken possession of, and he will make you successful, and he will make you more numerous than your ancestors.
\verse “And Adonai your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring to love Adonai your God with all your heart and with all your inner self \textit{so that you may live}.
\verse And Adonai your God will put all these curses on your enemies and \textit{on those who hate you}, \textit{on} \textit{those who harassed you}.
\verse And \textit{you will again listen} to the voice of Adonai, and you will do all his commandments that I \textit{am} commanding you \textit{today}.
\verse And Adonai your God will make you prosperous \textit{in all your undertakings}, and in the fruit of your livestock and in the fruit of your ground \textit{abundantly}, for Adonai \textit{will again rejoice} over you, \textit{just} as he rejoiced over your ancestors.
\verse \textit{He will do this} if you listen to the voice of Adonai your God by keeping his commandment and his statutes written in the scroll of this law \textit{and} if you return to Adonai your God with all your heart and with all your inner self.
\verse “For this commandment that I \textit{am} commanding you \textit{today} \textit{is} \textit{not too wonderful for you}, and it \textit{is} not \textit{too} far \textit{from you}.
\verse It is not in the heavens \textit{so that you might say}, ‘Who will go up for us to the heavens and get it for us and cause us to hear it, so that we may do it?’
\verse And \textit{it is} \textit{not beyond the sea}, \textit{so that you might say}, ‘Who will cross for us to the other side of the sea and take it for us and cause us to hear it, so that we may do it?’
\verse But the word is very near you, \textit{even} in your mouth and in your heart, \textit{so that you may do it}.
\verse “See, I am setting \textit{before you} \textit{today} life and prosperity and death and disaster;
\verse what I am commanding you \textit{today} \textit{is} to love Adonai your God by going in his ways and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his regulations, and then you will live, and you will become numerous, and Adonai your God will bless you in the \textit{land where you are going}.
\verse However, if your heart turns aside and you \textit{do} not listen and you are lured away and you bow down to other gods and you serve them,
\verse I declare to you \textit{today} that you will certainly perish; \textit{you will not extend your time} on the land that you are crossing the Jordan to go there to take possession of it.
\verse I invoke as a witness against you \textit{today} the heaven and the earth: life and death I have set \textit{before you}, blessing and curse. So choose life, so that you may live, you and your offspring,
\verse by loving Adonai your God by listening to his voice and by clinging to him, for he \textit{is} your life and the length of your days \textit{in order for you} to live on the land that Adonai swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 31
\verseWithHeading{Succession, Deposition, and Recitation of Text} And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
\verse And he said to them, “I am \textit{a} hundred and twenty years old \textit{today}; I am not able to go out and to come \textit{in} \textit{any} longer, and Adonai said to me, ‘You may not cross this Jordan.’
\verse Adonai your God \textit{is about to} cross \textit{before you}; he will destroy these nations \textit{before you}, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua \textit{will be} crossing \textit{before you}, \textit{just} as Adonai \textit{promised}.
\verse And Adonai will do to them \textit{just} as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and to their land, which he destroyed with them.
\verse And Adonai \textit{will deliver them to you before you}, and you shall do to them according to every commandment that I have commanded you.
\verse Be strong and be courageous; you should not be afraid, and you \textit{should not be in dread from their presence}, for Adonai your God \textit{is} the \textit{one} going with you; he will not leave you alone and he will not forsake you.”
\verse Then Moses summoned Joshua, and he said to him \textit{in the presence of all Israel}, “Be strong and be courageous, for you will go with this people into the land that Adonai swore to their ancestors to give to them, and you will give it to them as an inheritance.
\verse Adonai \textit{is} the \textit{one} going \textit{before you}; he will be with you, and he will not leave you alone, and he will not forsake you; you shall not be afraid, and you shall not be discouraged.”
\verse So Moses wrote this law, and he gave it to the priests, the descendants of Levi, the \textit{ones} carrying the ark of the covenant of Adonai, and to all the elders of Israel.
\verse Then Moses commanded them, \textit{saying}, “At the end of seven years, in the time of the year for canceling debts during the Feast of Booths,
\verse \textit{when all Israel comes to appear before} Adonai their God at the place that he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel \textit{in their hearing}.
\verse Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little children and your aliens that are in your \textit{towns}, so that they may hear and so that they may learn and they may revere Adonai your God, and \textit{they shall diligently observe} all the words of this law.
\verse And \textit{then} their children, who have not known, they \textit{too} may hear, and they may learn to revere Adonai their God all the days \textit{that you live} on the land that you \textit{are} crossing the Jordan \textit{to get there} to take possession of it.”
\verse Then Adonai said to Moses, “Look, \textit{you are about to die}; call Joshua and present yourselves in \textit{the} tent of assembly, so that I may instruct him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in \textit{the} tent of assembly.
\verse And Adonai appeared in the tent in a column of cloud, and the column of the cloud stood at the entrance of the tent.
\verse And Adonai said to Moses, “Look, you \textit{are} about to lie \textit{down} with your ancestors, and this people will arise and they will play the prostitute after \textit{the foreign gods} of the land \textit{to which they are going}.
\verse And \textit{my anger shall flare up against them} on that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall become as prey, and disasters and troubles shall find them, and they shall say on that day, ‘\textit{Is it} not because our God is not in our midst \textit{that} these disasters have found us?’
\verse But I will certainly hide my face on that day, because \textit{of} all of the evil that they did because they turned to other gods.
\verse “And so then write this song for yourselves and teach it to the \textit{Israelites}; put it in their mouth, so that this song may be for me as a witness against the \textit{Israelites}.
\verse For when I bring them into the land that I swore to their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey, \textit{they will eat their fill}, and they will become fat, and \textit{then} they will turn to other gods, and they will serve them, and they will spurn me, and they will break my covenant.
\verse \textit{And then} many disasters and troubles will come upon them, and this song will give evidence before them as a witness, because it will not be forgotten from \textit{out of} the mouth of their descendants, for I know their inclination that they \textit{are} having \textit{today} before I have brought them into the land that I swore.”
\verse And Moses wrote this song on that day and taught it \textit{to} the \textit{Israelites}.
\verse Then he told Joshua the son of Nun, and said \textit{to him}, “Be strong and be courageous, for you shall bring the \textit{Israelites} into the land that I swore to them, and I will be with you.”
\verse \textit{And then when Moses finished writing} the words of this law on the scroll \textit{until they were complete},
\verse then Moses commanded the Levites carrying the ark of the covenant of Adonai, \textit{saying},
\verse “Take the scroll of this law and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of Adonai your God, and it will be there as a witness against you.
\verse For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck \textit{even now} while I \textit{am} still alive with you \textit{today}, rebelling against Adonai, and \textit{how much more} after my death.
\verse Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officials, so that I may speak in their ears these words, and \textit{that} I may call as witness against them heaven and earth.
\verse For I know that after my death you will certainly act corruptly, and you will turn aside from the way that I have commanded you, and the disaster in the future days will befall you, because you will do evil in the eyes of Adonai, \textit{provoking him with the work of your hands}.”
\verse So Moses spoke into the ears of the assembly of Israel the words of this song \textit{until they were complete}.

\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 32
\verseWithHeading{The Song of Moses} “Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak, 
and let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
\verse May my teaching trickle like the dew, 
my words like rain showers on tender grass, 
and like spring showers on new growth.
\verse For I will proclaim the name of Adonai; 
ascribe greatness to our God!
\verse The Rock, his work \textit{is} perfect, 
for all his ways \textit{are} just; 
\textit{he is} a faithful God, and \textit{without injustice}; 
righteous and upright \textit{is} he.
\verse They \textit{have} behaved corruptly toward him; 
\textit{they are} not his children; \textit{this is} their flaw, 
a generation crooked and perverse.
\verse \textit{Like} this do you treat Adonai, 
foolish and \textit{unwise} people? 
\textit{Has} he not, your father, created you? 
He made you, and he established you.
\verse Remember \textit{the} old days, \textit{the years long past}; 
ask your father, and he will inform you, 
your elders and they will tell you.
\verse \textit{When the Most High apportioned} \textit{the} nations, 
at his dividing \textit{up} of the sons of humankind, 
he fixed the boundaries of \textit{the} peoples, 
according to the number of the children of Israel.
\verse For Adonai’s portion \textit{was} his people, 
Jacob the share of his inheritance.
\verse He found him in a desert land, 
and in a howling, desert wasteland; 
he \textit{encircled him}, he cared for him, 
he protected him like the \textit{apple} of his eye.
\verse As an eagle stirs up its nest, 
hovers over its young, 
spreads out its wings, takes them, 
carries them on its pinions,
\verse \textit{so} Adonai alone guided him, 
and \textit{there was no foreign god accompanying him}.
\verse And he set him on the high places of \textit{the} land, 
and he fed \textit{him} the crops of \textit{the} field, 
and he nursed him with honey from crags, 
and \textit{with} oil from flinty rock,
\verse \textit{With} curds from \textit{the} herd, 
and \textit{with} milk from \textit{the} flock, 
with \textit{the} fat of young rams, 
and rams, the offspring of Bashan, 
and with goats \textit{along} with the finest kernels of wheat, 
and \textit{from} the blood of grapes you drank fermented wine.
\verse And Jeshurun grew fat, and he kicked; 
you grew fat, you bloated, and you became obstinate; 
and he abandoned God, his maker, 
and he scoffed \textit{at} the rock of his salvation.
\verse They made him jealous with strange \textit{gods}; 
with detestable things they provoked him.
\verse They sacrificed to the demons, not God, 
\textit{to} gods whom they had not known, 
new \textit{gods} \textit{who} came from recent times; 
\textit{their ancestors had not known them}.
\verse \textit{The} rock who bore you, you neglected, 
and you forgot God, \textit{the one} giving you birth.
\verse Then Adonai saw, and he spurned \textit{them}, 
because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.
\verse So he said, ‘I will hide my face from them; 
I will see what \textit{will be} their end, 
for they \textit{are} a generation of perversity, 
\textit{children in whom there is no faithfulness}.
\verse They annoyed me with \textit{what is} not a god; 
they provoked me with their idols. 
So I will make them jealous with \textit{those} not a people, 
with a foolish nation I will provoke them.
\verse For a fire was kindled by my anger, 
and it burned \textit{up to the depths of Sheol}, 
and it devoured \textit{the} earth and its produce, 
and it set afire the foundation of \textit{the} mountains.
\verse I will heap disasters upon them; 
my arrows I will spend on them.
\verse \textit{They will become} weakened by famine, 
and consumed by plague and bitter pestilence; 
and the teeth of wild animals I will send against them, 
with \textit{the} poison of \textit{the} creeping \textit{things} in \textit{the} dust;
\verse From outside \textit{her boundaries} the sword will make \textit{her} childless, 
and from inside, terror; 
both \textit{for} \textit{the} young man \textit{and} also the young woman, 
the infant \textit{along with} the gray-headed man.
\verse I thought, “I will wipe them out; 
\textit{I will make people forget they ever existed}.”
\verse If I had not feared a provocation of \textit{the} enemy, 
lest their foes might misunderstand,  
lest they should say,  “Our hand is 
\textit{triumphant}, and Adonai \textit{did} not do all this.” ’
\verse For \textit{they are a nation void of sense}, 
and there is not \textit{any} understanding in them.
\verse If only they were wise, they would understand this; 
they would discern \textit{for themselves their end}.
\verse How could one chase a thousand 
and two could cause a myriad to flee, 
if their Rock had not sold them, 
and Adonai had \textit{not} given them up?
\verse For the fact of the matter is, 
their rock \textit{is} not like our Rock, 
and our enemies recognize \textit{this}.
\verse For their vine \textit{is} from the vine of Sodom, 
and from the terraces of Gomorrah; 
their grapes \textit{are} grapes of poison; 
\textit{their clusters are bitter}.
\verse Their wine \textit{is} the poison of snakes, 
and \textit{the} deadly poison of horned vipers.
\verse ‘\textit{Is} not this stored up with me, 
sealed in my treasuries?’
\verse \textit{Vengeance belongs to me} and \textit{also} recompense, 
\textit{for at the time their foot slips}, 
because the day of their disaster \textit{is} near, 
\textit{and fate comes quickly for them}.’
\verse For Adonai will judge \textit{on behalf of} his people, 
and concerning his servants; 
he will change his mind when he sees that \textit{their} power has disappeared, 
and \textit{there is} no one left, confined or free.
\verse And he will say, ‘Where \textit{are} their gods, 
\textit{their} rock in whom they took refuge?
\verse Who ate the fat of their sacrifices 
\textit{and} drank the wine of their libations? 
Let them rise \textit{up}, and let them help you; 
\textit{Let them be to you a refuge}.
\verse See, now, that I, \textit{even} I \textit{am} he, 
and there is not a god besides me; 
I put to death and I give life; 
I wound and I heal; 
there is not \textit{one} who delivers from my hand!
\verse For \textit{indeed} I lift up my hand to heaven, 
And I promise \textit{as I live forever},
\verse When I sharpen \textit{my flashing sword}, 
and my hand takes hold \textit{of it} in judgment, 
\textit{I will take reprisals against my foes}, 
and my haters I will repay.
\verse I will make my arrows drunk with blood, 
and my sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain, 
and captives from the heads of the leaders of \textit{the} enemy.’
\verse Call for songs of joy, O nations, \textit{concerning} his people, 
for the blood of his servants he will avenge, 
\textit{and he will take reprisals against his foes}, 
and he will make atonement \textit{for} his land, his people.”
\verse And Moses came, and he spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people; \textit{that is}, he and Joshua the son of Nun.
\verse \textit{And when Moses finished speaking} all these words to all Israel,
\verse then he said to them, “\textit{Take to heart all the words} that I \textit{am} admonishing \textit{against} you \textit{today} \textit{concerning} which you should instruct them \textit{with respect to} your children \textit{so that they will observe diligently} all the words of this law,
\verse for it \textit{is} not a trifling matter among you, but it \textit{is} your life, and through this word \textit{you will live long in the land} that you \textit{are about} to cross the Jordan \textit{to get} there to take possession of it.”
\verseWithHeading{Instructions Concerning Moses’ Death} And Adonai said to Moses on exactly this day, \textit{saying},
\verse “Go up to this mountain of the Abarim \textit{range}, Mount Nebo, which \textit{is} \textit{opposite Jericho}, and see the land of Canaan that I \textit{am} giving to the \textit{Israelites} as \textit{a} possession.
\verse You shall die on that mountain that you \textit{are} about to go up there, and \textit{you will} be gathered to your people, \textit{just} as your brother Aaron died on \textit{Mount Hor} and he was gathered to his people,
\verse because \textit{of the fact} that you broke faith with me in the midst of Israel at the waters of Meribah Kadesh, \textit{in} the desert of Zin, because \textit{you did not treat me as holy} in the midst of the \textit{Israelites}.
\verse Yes, from afar you may view the land, but there you shall not enter there, \textit{that is}, into the land that I \textit{am} giving to the \textit{Israelites}.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Deuteronomy 33
\verseWithHeading{Blessings of Moses on Israel} Now this \textit{is} the blessing \textit{with} which Moses, the man of God, blessed the \textit{Israelites} \textit{before} his death.
\verse Then he said,
\verse “Adonai came from Sinai, 
and he dawned upon them from Seir; 
he shone forth from Mount Paran, 
and he came with myriads of holy ones, 
at his right hand a fiery law for them.
\verse Moreover, \textit{he loves his people}, 
all the holy ones \textit{were} in your hand, 
and they bowed down to your feet, 
\textit{each one accepted directions from you}.
\verse A law Moses instructed for us, 
\textit{as a} possession \textit{for} the assembly of Jacob.
\verse And \textit{then} a king arose in Jeshurun, 
at the gathering of the leaders of \textit{the} people, 
\textit{united were the tribes of Israel}.
\verse “May Reuben live, and may he not die, 
\textit{and let his number not be few}.”
\verse \textit{And he said this of Judah}, 
“Hear, O Adonai, the voice of Judah, 
and bring him to his people; 
his own hands strive for him, 
and may you be a help \textit{against} his foes.”
\verse And of Levi he said, 
“Your Thummim and your Urim 
\textit{are} for \textit{your faithful one}, 
\textit{whom you tested at Massah}; 
you contended \textit{with} him 
at the waters of Meribah.
\verse The \textit{one} saying of his father and of his mother, 
‘I have not regarded them,’ 
and his brothers he \textit{did} not acknowledge, 
and his children \textit{he did} not know, 
but \textit{rather} they observed your word, 
and your covenant they kept.
\verse They taught your regulations to Jacob, 
and your law to Israel; 
they placed incense smoke \textit{before you}, 
and whole burnt offerings on your altar.
\verse Bless, O Adonai, his substance, 
and with the work of his hands you must be pleased; 
smite the loins of those who attack him, 
and those hating him, \textit{so that they cannot arise}.”
\verse Of Benjamin he said, 
“The beloved of Adonai dwells \textit{securely}, 
the Most High shields \textit{all} around him, 
all the day, 
and between his shoulders he dwells.”
\verse And of Joseph he said, 
“Blessed by Adonai \textit{is} his land, 
with the choice things of heaven, 
with dew, and with the deep lying down beneath,
\verse and with \textit{the} choice things of \textit{the} fruits of the \textit{the} sun, 
and with the choice things of \textit{the} yield of \textit{the} \textit{seasons},
\verse and with the finest things of \textit{the} ancient mountains, 
and with \textit{the} choice things of \textit{the} \textit{eternal hills},
\verse and with the choice things of \textit{the} earth and its fullness, 
and the favor of \textit{the one} \textit{who dwelt} in \textit{the} bush. 
Let them come to the head of Joseph, 
and to the crown of the prince among his brothers.
\verse \textit{As} the firstborn of his ox, majesty \textit{belongs to him}, 
and his horns \textit{are} \textit{the} horns of a wild ox; 
with them he drives people together, 
and they \textit{are} the myriads of Ephraim, 
and they \textit{are} the thousands of Manasseh.”
\verse And of Zebulun he said, 
“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, 
and \textit{rejoice}, Issachar, in your tents;
\verse They summon people \textit{to the} mountains; 
there they sacrifice the sacrifices of righteousness, 
because the affluence of \textit{the} seas they suck \textit{out}, 
and \textit{the most hidden treasures of the sand}.”
\verse And of Gad he said, 
“Blessed \textit{be} \textit{the one who enlarges Gad}; 
like a lion he dwells, 
and he tears an arm as well as a scalp.
\verse And he selected \textit{the} best \textit{part} for himself,  
for there \textit{the} portion of a ruler \textit{is} included, 
and he came \textit{with the} heads of \textit{the} people; 
he did the righteousness of Adonai, 
and his regulations for Israel.”
\verse And of Dan he said, 
“Dan \textit{is} a cub of \textit{a} lion; 
he leaps from Bashan.”
\verse And of Naphtali, he said, 
“Oh, Naphtali, sated of favor, 
and full of the blessing of Adonai; 
take possession of \textit{the} lake, 
and \textit{the land to the} south.”
\verse And of Asher he said, 
“Blessed \textit{more than sons} \textit{is} Asher; 
\textit{may he be the favorite} of his brothers, 
\textit{dipping his feet in the oil}.
\verse Your bars \textit{are} iron and bronze, 
and as your days, \textit{so is} your strength.”
\verse “There is no \textit{one} like God, O, Jeshurun, 
who rides \textit{through} the heavens to your help, 
and with his majesty \textit{through the} skies.
\verse The God of \textit{ancient time} \textit{is} a hiding place, 
and underneath \textit{are} \textit{the} arms of eternity, 
and he drove out \textit{from before} you your enemy, 
and he said, ‘Destroy \textit{them}!’
\verse So Israel dwells alone \textit{and} carefree, 
the spring of Jacob in a land of grain and wine; 
his heavens even drip dew.

\verseWithHeading{The Death of Moses and the Commissioning of Joshua} Then Moses went up from the desert plateau of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, \textit{which is opposite} Jericho, and Adonai showed him all of the land, Gilead \textit{all the way} up to Dan,
\verse and all of Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh and all of the land of Judah, up to the western sea,
\verse and the Negev and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palms, \textit{on} up to Zoar.

\verse Then Moses, the servant of Adonai, died there in the land of Moab \textit{according to the command of Adonai}.

\verse And the \textit{Israelites} wept \textit{concerning} Moses thirty days; \textit{finally} the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were completed.
\verse Now Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom because Moses had placed his hands on him, and the \textit{Israelites} listened to him, and they did as Adonai had commanded Moses.
\verse And not again has a prophet arisen in Israel like Moses, whom Adonai knew face to face,
\verse as far as all the signs and the wonders Adonai sent him to do in the land of Egypt, against Pharaoh and all of his servants and against all of his land,
\verse and as far as all of \textit{the mighty deeds} and as far as \textit{the great awesome wonders} Moses did before the eyes of all Israel.
