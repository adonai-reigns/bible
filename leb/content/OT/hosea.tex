\begin{biblechapter} % Hosea 1
\verseWithHeading{God Commands Hosea to Start a Family} The word of Adonai that came to Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, the kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
\verse \textit{At the beginning when Adonai spoke} through Hosea, 
Adonai said to Hosea, 
“Go, take for yourself a wife and children of whoredom, 
because the land commits great whoredom 
\textit{forsaking Adonai}.”
\verse So he went and took Gomer daughter of Diblaim, 
and she conceived and bore him a son.
\verse And Adonai said to him, 
“\textit{Name him} Jezreel; 
because in a little while \textit{I will punish} the house of Jehu 
for the blood of Jezreel, 
and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
\verse \textit{On that day} 
I will break the bow of Israel 
in the Valley of Jezreel.”
\verse And she conceived again and bore a daughter, and he said to him,
\verse “\textit{Name her} Lo-ruhamah, 
for I will no longer have pity 
on the house of Israel 
or \textit{forgive them}.
\verse But I will have pity \textit{on} the house of Judah 
and I will save them by Adonai their God, 
and will not deliver them 
by bow, sword, war, 
horses, or horsemen.
\verse And when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son.
\verse And he said, “\textit{Name him} Lo-ammi, 
for you \textit{are} not my people 
and I am not your \textit{God}.
\verse  The number of the children of Israel 
will be like the sand of the sea 
that cannot be measured or counted; 
and in the place where it is said to them, 
“You are not my people,” 
it will be said to them, 
“Children of \textit{the} living God.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Hosea 2
\verseWithHeading{The Unfaithful Wife} Say to your brother, “Ammi,” 
and to your sister, “Ruhamah.”
\verse Plead with your mother, plead— 
because she \textit{is} not my wife, 
and I \textit{am} not her husband. 
Let her put away her whoring \textit{from before her}, 
and her adultery from between her breasts.
\verse Lest I strip her naked 
and expose her like the day when she was born; 
I will make her like the desert 
and turn her into parched land; 
I will kill her with thirst.
\verse And I will not have pity on her children, 
because \textit{they are} children of whoredom.
\verse Because their mother was unfaithful; 
she who conceived them has acted shamefully, 
for she said: 
“I will go after my lovers, 
the ones who give \textit{me} my bread, my water, 
my wool, and my flax, 
my oil, and my drink.”
\verse Therefore, Look! 
I \textit{am} going to hedge her path \textit{with thorns}, 
and I will build a stone wall, a stone wall \textit{against} her, 
and she will not find her paths.
\verse Then she will pursue \textit{her lovers}, 
but she will not overtake them; 
she will seek them and not find \textit{them}; 
and she will say, “I will go 
and return to my first husband 
because \textit{it was} better for me then than now.”
\verse But she did not know 
that \textit{it was} I who gave her 
grain, new wine, and oil, 
and who gave her silver in abundance, 
and gold which they made into a Baal.
\verse Therefore I will take again 
my grain in its time, 
and my wine in its season; 
and I will take away my wool and my flax, 
\textit{which were} to cover her nakedness.
\verse And now I will uncover her nakedness 
before the eyes of her lovers, 
and no one will rescue her from my hand.
\verse And I will put an end to all her mirth, 
her festivals, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, 
and all her appointed festivals;
\verse and I will lay waste to her vines and her fig trees, 
of which she said, 
“They \textit{are} my payment for prostitution, 
which my lovers gave to me.” 
I will make them a forest, 
and the wild animals of the field will devour them.
\verse \textit{I will punish her} \textit{for} the days of the Baals, 
to whom she burns incense, 
and she decked herself \textit{with} her ornamental ring and jewelry, 
and she went after her lovers, and forgot me 
—a declaration of Adonai.
\verse Therefore, Look! I \textit{am} going to allure her 
and bring her \textit{into} the desert, 
and \textit{I will speak tenderly to her}.
\verse From there I will give her 
her vineyards, 
and the Valley of Achor as a doorway of hope. 
And there she will respond, 
as \textit{in} the days of her youth, 
just as \textit{in} the day of her coming out of 
the land of Egypt.
\verse \textit{And on that day}— 
a declaration of Adonai— 
you will call me, “My husband;” 
you will no longer call me, “My Baal.”
\verse I will remove the names 
of the Baals from her mouth, 
and they will no longer be mentioned by their name.
\verse I will make a covenant for them on that day, 
with the animals of the field, 
with the birds of the heaven, and 
\textit{with} the creeping things of the ground; 
\textit{the} bow, \textit{the} sword, and \textit{the} war I will abolish from the land, and I will let them lie down in safety.
\verse And I will take you as my wife forever; 
I will take you as a wife for myself in righteousness and in justice, 
in steadfast love and in mercy.
\verse \textit{I will take you as my wife} in faithfulness, 
and you will know Adonai.
\verse On that day I will answer, \textit{declares Adonai}, 
I will answer the heavens, 
and they will answer the earth.
\verse And the earth will answer 
the grain, the wine, and the oil, 
and they will answer Jezreel.
\verse I will sow her for myself in the land; 
I will have pity on Lo-ruhama; 
I will say to Lo-ammi, 
“You are my people,” 
and he himself will say, “\textit{you are} my God.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Hosea 3
\verseWithHeading{Another Symbolic Marriage} And Adonai said to me again, 
“Go, love a woman 
\textit{who has a lover} and \textit{is} committing adultery, 
just like the love of Adonai \textit{for} the children of Israel, 
but they \textit{are} turning to other gods 
and love raisin cakes.”
\verse So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver 
and a homer of barely and a measure of wine.
\verse And I said to her, 
“\textit{You must remain as mine} for many days, 
and you will not play the whore; 
\textit{you will not belong} to a man, 
and I \textit{will} belong to you.”
\verse The children of Israel will remain for many days 
without a king and prince, 
without sacrifice and stone pillar, ephod and teraphim.
\verse Afterward the children of Israel will return 
and seek Adonai their God and David their king. 
They will come in fear to Adonai 
and to his goodness at the end of days.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hosea 4
\verseWithHeading{Adonai Has an Indictment} Hear the word of Adonai, \textit{O} children of Israel, 
for Adonai has an indictment against the inhabitants of the land. 
There is no faithfulness or loyalty, 
there is no knowledge of God in the land.
\verse Swearing and lying, 
murdering and stealing, 
and adultery break out, 
and bloodshed follows bloodshed.
\verse Therefore the land mourns, 
and all \textit{those} living in it languish 
with the animals of the field, 
and the birds of the heaven, 
and even the fish of the sea 
are being swept away.
\verse Yet, let no one contend, 
and let no one accuse, 
for with you, O priest, \textit{is my} contention.
\verse You will stumble \textit{by} day, 
and the priest also will stumble 
with you at night. 
And I will destroy your mother;
\verse My people are destroyed 
for lack of knowledge; 
because you have rejected knowledge, 
I reject you from acting as a priest for me. 
And since you have forgotten the law of your God, 
I will also forget your children.
\verse When they became many, their sin increased against me; 
they changed their glory into shame.
\verse \textit{They feed on the sin of my people}, 
\textit{they are greedy} for their iniquity.
\verse And it will be like people, like priest; 
I will punish them \textit{for} their ways, 
and I will requite them for their deeds.
\verse They will eat and not be satisfied; 
they will play the whore and not multiply, 
because they have forsaken Adonai \textit{to devote themselves to
\verse whoredom}. 
Wine and new wine \textit{take away the understanding}.
\verse My people, 
consult \textit{their wooden idols}, 
and their divining rod gives them oracles; 
because a spirit of whoredom led \textit{them} astray, 
and they played the whore from under their God.
\verse On the tops of the mountains they sacrifice, 
and on the hills they make offerings, 
under oak, poplar, and terebinth, 
because their shade is good. 
Therefore your daughters play the whore, 
and all your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
\verse \textit{I will not punish your daughters} when they play the whore, 
or your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery; 
because they go aside with whores, 
and they sacrifice with temple prostitutes, 
a people that does not understand comes to ruin.
\verse Even though you, \textit{O} Israel, \textit{are} playing the whore, 
do not let Judah become guilty; 
do not enter Gilgal, 
or go up \textit{to} Beth-aven; 
and do not swear, 
“\textit{As Adonai lives}!”
\verse Indeed, like a stubborn heifer, 
Israel is stubborn; 
Now Adonai will feed them, 
like a lamb in broad pasture.
\verse Ephraim is joined to idols; 
let him alone.
\verse When their drinking has ended, 
they surely indulge in sexual orgies. 
They love lewdness more than their glory.
\verse A wind has wrapped them in its wings, 
and they will be ashamed because of their altars.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hosea 5
\verseWithHeading{The Priests Are a Snare} Hear this, \textit{O} priests! 
Give heed, \textit{O} house of Israel! 
Listen, \textit{O} house of the king! 
Because the judgment \textit{applies} to you; 
because you have been a snare for Mizpah, 
and a net spread out on Tabor;
\verse they dug a deep pit \textit{in} Shittim, 
but I \textit{am} a punishment for all of them.
\verse I myself know Ephraim, 
and Israel is not hidden from me; 
because now you have played the whore, \textit{O} Ephraim— 
Israel is defiled.
\verse Their deeds do not permit them 
to return them to God. 
Because a spirit of whoredom \textit{is} in their midst, 
they do not know Adonai.
\verse The pride of Israel testifies \textit{against him}, 
and Israel and Ephraim stumble in their guilt, 
and Judah stumbles with them.
\verse With their flocks and herds they will go 
to seek Adonai, but they will not find him; 
he has withdrawn from them.
\verse They have dealt faithlessly with Adonai 
because they have borne illegitimate children. 
Now \textit{the} new moon will devour them with their fields.
\verse Blow the \textit{horn} in Gibeah, 
\textit{the} trumpet in Ramah. 
Sound the alarm \textit{in} Beth-aven; 
\textit{look} behind you, Benjamin.
\verse Ephraim will be a desolation 
in the day of punishment; 
among the tribes of Israel 
I will reveal what is true.
\verse The princes of Judah have become 
like those who remove a landmark; 
on them I will pour out 
my wrath like water.
\verse Ephraim is oppressed, 
crushed \textit{in} judgment, 
because he was determined 
to go after filth.
\verse But I \textit{am} like a maggot to Ephraim 
and like rottenness to the house of Judah.
\verse And \textit{when} Ephraim saw his illness, 
and Judah his wound, 
Ephraim went to Assyria, 
he sent to the great king. 
But he was unable to cure you 
and heal your wound.
\verse Because I \textit{will be} like a lion to Ephraim 
and like a fierce strong lion to the house of Judah. 
I myself will tear and I will go; 
I will carry off, and there is no one who delivers.
\verse \textit{I will return again} to my place 
until they acknowledge \textit{their} guilt 
and seek my face; 
in their distress they will search me.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hosea 6
\verseWithHeading{A Call to Adonai} Come, let us return to Adonai; 
because \textit{it is} he who has torn, and he will heal us; 
he has struck us down and will bind us up.
\verse He will revive us after two days; 
on the third day he will raise us up, 
that we may live in his presence.
\verse Let us know, let us press on to know Adonai; 
his rising \textit{is} sure like \textit{the} dawn. 
He will come like the showers to us, 
like \textit{the} spring rain that waters \textit{the} earth.
\verse What will I do with you, \textit{O} Ephraim? 
What will I do with you, \textit{O} Judah? 
Your love \textit{is} like a morning cloud, 
like the dew that goes away early in the morning.
\verse Therefore, I have hewn \textit{them} by \textit{the} prophets; 
I have killed them by the words of my mouth, 
and my judgment goes forth like the light.
\verse Because I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, 
and knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
\verse But like Adam, they transgressed \textit{the} covenant; 
there they dealt faithlessly with me.
\verse Gilead \textit{is} a city of evil, 
a cunning \textit{city} because of blood.
\verse Like bandits lying in wait, 
\textit{so is} a band of priests; 
they murder \textit{on the} road to Shechem; 
indeed, they commit a monstrous crime.
\verse In the house of Israel I have seen something horrible; 
Ephraim’s unfaithfulness \textit{is} there. 
Israel is defiled.
\verseWithHeading{Ephraim’s Guilt} For you also, \textit{O} Judah, a harvest is appointed, 
when I restore the fortunes of my people,
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hosea 7
\verse when I would heal Israel, 
and the corruption of Ephraim is revealed, 
and the wicked deeds of Samaria; 
because they deal \textit{in} falsehood, 
\textit{the} thief breaks in, 
\textit{and the} bandit raids the outside.
\verse \textit{But they did not consider} 
that I remember all their wickedness. 
Now their deeds surround them; 
they are before my face.
\verse By their wickedness they make \textit{the} king glad, 
and \textit{the} officials by their treacheries.
\verse All of them commit adultery, 
like a burning oven 
whose baker has stopped from stirring the fire, 
and from kneading \textit{the} dough until it is leavened.
\verse \textit{On} the day of our king, the princes 
became sick \textit{with} the heat of wine; 
he stretched out his hand with mockers.
\verse Because they are kindled like an oven, 
their heart burns within them; 
all night their anger \textit{smolders}, 
\textit{in the} morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
\verse All of them are hot as an oven, 
and they devour their rulers. 
All their kings have fallen; 
there is none who calls to me amongst them.
\verse Ephraim mixes himself 
with the nations; 
Ephraim is a bread cake 
not turned over.
\verse Foreigners devour his strength, 
and he does not know \textit{it}; 
\textit{mold} is also sprinkled upon him, 
and he does not know \textit{it}.
\verse The pride of Israel \textit{testifies against him}— 
they do not return to Adonai their God; 
they do not seek him for all of this.
\verse Ephraim was like a dove, 
silly, \textit{without sense}; 
they call \textit{to} Egypt, 
they go \textit{to} Assyria.
\verse Just as they go, I will cast my net 
over them; 
I will bring them down 
like the birds of the heavens; 
I will discipline them 
according to a report to their assembly.
\verse Woe to them, because they have strayed from me! 
Destruction to them, because they have rebelled against me! 
I myself would redeem them, 
but they speak lies against me.
\verse They do not cry out to me from their heart, 
but they wail on their beds; 
because of grain and new wine they lacerate themselves; 
they depart from me.
\verse And I myself trained 
and strengthened their arms; 
but they plan evil against me.
\verse They turn, not to the Most High, 
like a slack bow; 
their officials will fall by the sword 
because of the anger of their tongue. 
This \textit{is} their scorn 
in the land of Egypt.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Hosea 8
\verseWithHeading{Israel Rejects the Good} \textit{Put} to your lips \textit{the} trumpet 
like a vulture over the house of Adonai, 
because they have \textit{broken my covenant} 
and rebelled against my law.
\verse They cry out to me, 
“My God! We, Israel, know you!”
\verse Israel has spurned \textit{the} good; 
\textit{the} enemy will pursue him.
\verse They appointed kings, but not through me; 
they made officials, but without my knowledge. 
\textit{With} their silver and gold 
they made idols for themselves 
for their own \textit{destruction}.
\verse Your calf is rejected, \textit{O} Samaria; 
my anger burns against them. 
How long will they be incapable of innocence?
\verse Because \textit{it is} from Israel, 
an artisan made it, 
it \textit{is} not a god; 
for the calf of Samaria 
will be broken \textit{to} pieces.
\verse Because they sow the wind, 
they will reap the whirlwind. 
\textit{The} standing grain does not have heads; 
it will not yield flour. 
\textit{And} if it would yield, 
strangers would devour it.
\verse Israel is swallowed up; 
now they are among the nations, 
like an object that no one desires.
\verse For they have gone up \textit{to} Assyria, 
a wild donkey alone to itself; 
Ephraim has sold itself \textit{for} lovers.
\verse Even though they have sold themselves to the nations, 
now I will gather them. 
They will soon writhe 
from the burden of kings and princes.
\verse When Ephraim multiplied altars 
to expiate sins, 
they became to him altars to sin \textit{on}.
\verse I write for him myriads of my instruction; 
they are regarded as a strange thing.
\verse They offer sacrifices of my choice 
and they eat flesh; 
Adonai does not accept them. 
Now he will remember their iniquity 
and punish their sins; 
they will return \textit{to} Egypt.
\verse Israel has forgotten his maker and built palaces, 
and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; 
but I will send fire on his cities 
and it will devour her strongholds.

\verseWithHeading{Ephraim Faces Punishment} Do not rejoice, \textit{O} Israel, 
do not exult like the nations! 
For you played the whore, departing from your God; 
you loved a harlot’s wage 
on all the threshing floors of grain.
\verse Threshing floor and wine vat will not feed them, 
and new wine will fail her.
\verse They will not remain 
in the land of Adonai. 
But Ephraim will return \textit{to} Egypt, 
and in Assyria they will eat unclean food.
\verse They will not pour \textit{drink offerings of} wine to Adonai, 
and their sacrifices will not please him. 
\textit{They are} like mourners’ bread for them; 
all those who eat it will be defiled. 
For their bread will be \textit{for their hunger}; 
it will not come \textit{to} the house of Adonai.
\verse What will you do on the day of \textit{the} appointed time, 
and on the day of the festival of Adonai?
\verse For look! \textit{If} they flee from the destruction, 
Egypt will gather them; 
Memphis will bury them. 
Nettles will possess 
their precious things of silver; 
thorns \textit{will be} in their tents.
\verse The days of punishment have come; 
the days of retribution have come; 
Israel knows! 
The prophet \textit{is} a fool, 
the man of the spirit \textit{is} acting like a madman. 
Because of the greatness of your sin, 
\textit{your} hostility \textit{is} great.
\verse The prophet keeps watch \textit{over} Ephraim for my God; 
the snare of a fowler \textit{is} on all his ways, 
and hostility in the house of his God.
\verse \textit{They deeply corrupted themselves} 
as \textit{in} the days of Gibeah; 
he will remember their sin, 
he will punish their sins.
\verse Like the grapes in the wilderness, 
I found Israel. 
Like early ripened fruit on the fig tree in the first season, 
I saw your ancestors. 
They themselves came \textit{to} Baal Peor, 
and they consecrated themselves to shame. 
And they became detestable things, 
like \textit{the thing they love}.
\verse Ephraim’s glory \textit{is} like a bird; 
it will fly away— 
no birth, no pregnancy, and no conception.
\verse Even though they bring up their children, 
I will bereave them before maturity. 
Woe to them indeed, 
when I depart from them!
\verse Ephraim, as I see \textit{it}, 
\textit{is} like a palm in a meadow; 
but Ephraim must bring out 
his children to the slayer.
\verse Give them, \textit{O} Adonai— 
what will you give \textit{them}? 
Give them a miscarrying womb 
and dry breasts.
\verse Every evil of theirs \textit{began} at Gilgal, 
so I \textit{began} to hate them there; 
because of the evil of their deeds 
I will drive them out from my house. 
I will love them no more; 
all their officials \textit{are} rebels.
\verse Ephraim is stricken, 
their root is dried up, 
they shall not bear fruit. 
Even if they give birth, 
I will kill the cherished offspring of their womb.
\verse My God will reject them 
because they did not listen to him, 
and they will be wanderers among the nations.

\verseWithHeading{Israel Is Punished} Israel \textit{is} a luxuriant vine; 
he yields fruit for himself. 
The more his fruit increased, 
\textit{the more} he made numerous altars. 
The more his land prospered, 
\textit{the more} he improved \textit{his} stone pillars.
\verse Their heart is false; 
now they must bear \textit{their} guilt. 
He himself will break down their altars; 
he will destroy their stone pillars.
\verse For now they will say, 
“We have no king; 
indeed, we did not fear Adonai, 
and what can a king do for us?”
\verse They utter words of vain oaths 
\textit{when} \textit{making covenants}, 
and judgment blossoms like a poisonous plant 
on the furrows of the field.
\verse The inhabitants of Samaria tremble 
for the calf of Beth-aven. 
Indeed, his people will mourn for it, 
and his idolatrous priests will wail over it— 
over its glory because it has departed from it.
\verse It will also be brought to Assyria, 
\textit{as} tribute to \textit{the} great king. 
Ephraim will obtain disgrace 
and Israel will be ashamed from his advice.
\verse Samaria will be destroyed; 
her king \textit{is} like a chip on the surface of the water.
\verse The high places of Aven, 
the sin of Israel, will be destroyed. 
Thorn and thistle will grow 
on their altars. 
They will say to the mountains, “Cover us,” 
and to the hills, “Fall on us.”
\verse From the days of Gibeah you have sinned, \textit{O} Israel; 
there \textit{they have remained}. 
Will not war in Gibeah overtake them 
against the children of evil?
\verse In my desire I will punish them; 
nations will be gathered against them 
when they are punished for \textit{their double iniquities}.
\verse Ephraim \textit{was} a trained heifer, 
that loved to thresh \textit{grain}, 
and I myself \textit{spared} 
the fairness of her neck; 
I will make Ephraim break the ground, 
Judah will plow, 
Jacob must till for himself.
\verse Sow for yourselves righteousness; 
\textit{reap loyal love}. 
Break up for yourself fallow ground; 
\textit{it is} time to seek Adonai 
so he will come and rain 
righteousness upon you.
\verse You have plowed wickedness, 
you have reaped injustice, 
you have eaten the fruit of lies, 
because you have trusted in your strength, 
in the multitude of your warriors.
\verse The tumult of war will rise up against your people, 
and all your fortresses will be destroyed, 
as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel; 
on the day of war 
mothers were dashed to pieces with \textit{their} children.
\verse So it will be done to you, \textit{O} Bethel, 
because of the evil of your wickedness; 
at dawn, the king of Israel 
will be utterly destroyed.

\verseWithHeading{God Will Have Compassion} When Israel was a child, I loved him, 
and out of Egypt I called my son.
\verse When I called them, they went from my face. 
They sacrificed to the Baals, and they sacrificed to idols.
\verse And I myself taught Ephraim to walk; 
I took them in my arms, 
but they did not know that I healed them.
\verse I drew them \textit{with human ties}, 
with the bands of love. 
I was to them like one who lifted up a yoke on their jaws, 
\textit{though} I bent down to them \textit{and} let them eat.
\verse He will return to the land of Egypt, 
and Assyria will be his king, 
because they refused to return.

it consumes his false prophets 
and devours because of their plans.
\verse My people are bent on backsliding from me. 
To the Most High they call, 
he does not raise them at all.
\verse How can I give you up, \textit{O} Ephraim? 
\textit{How} can I hand you over, \textit{O} Israel? 
How can I make you like Admah? 
\textit{How} can I treat you like Zeboiim? 
My heart is disturbed within me; 
\textit{all} my compassions are aroused.
\verse \textit{I will not execute} \textit{my fierce anger}, 
I will not again destroy Ephraim; 
because I \textit{am} God 
and not a mortal, 
\textit{the} Holy \textit{One} in your midst; 
and I will not come in wrath.
\verse They will go after Adonai; 
he roars like a lion. 
When he roars, 
his children will come trembling 
from \textit{the} sea.

and like doves from the land of Assyria; 
and I will let them return to their homes—

\verse Adonai the God of hosts, 
Adonai \textit{is} his renowned name!
\verse But you, you must return to your God; 
keep love and justice, 
and wait continually for your God.
\verse \textit{The} trader, in his hand \textit{are} scales of deceit; 
he loves to oppress.
\verse And Ephraim said, “Surely, I am rich, 
I gained wealth for myself; 
in all my toil they have not found guilt in me 
that is \textit{sin}.
\verse But I \textit{am} Adonai your God 
since the land of Egypt; 
I will make you live in tents again, 
like the days of \textit{the} appointed festival.
\verse I spoke to the prophets; 
I myself multiplied revelations 
and through the hand of the prophets I will destroy.
\verse If \textit{in} Gilead \textit{there is} evil, 
surely they will come to nothing. 
In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls, 
also their altars will be like stone heaps 
on furrows of \textit{the} field.
\verse Jacob fled \textit{to} the open field of Aram, 
and Israel served for a wife, 
and for a wife he watched over \textit{sheep}.
\verse And by a prophet Adonai brought 
Israel up from Egypt, 
and by a prophet 
he was watched over.
\verse Ephraim has caused bitter provocation, 
and his Lord will \textit{hold him responsible for his crimes} 
and pay back to him his insults.

\verseWithHeading{Adonai’s Judgment on Idolatrous Israel} When Ephraim spoke, \textit{there was} terror; 
he was exalted in Israel, 
but he incurred guilt through Baal and died.
\verse And now they sin again, 
and they make for themselves a molten idol, 
idols from their silver metal according to their understanding, 
all of them the work of skilled craftsmen. 
To these they say, “Sacrifice!” 
People are kissing bull calves.
\verse Therefore, they will be like the morning cloud, 
and like \textit{the} dew of early morning going \textit{away}, 
like chaff swirling from \textit{the} threshing floor, 
or like smoke from a window.
\verse I \textit{am} Adonai your God 
since the land of Egypt; 
you know no god except me, 
and no one saves besides me.
\verse I fed you in the desert, 
in the land of drought.
\verse When I fed them, they were satisfied; 
they were satisfied and their heart was lifted up; 
therefore they forgot me.
\verse And I will be like a lion to them; 
I lie in wait beside \textit{the} way, like a leopard.
\verse I will attack them like a bear robbed of her offspring, 
and I will tear open the covering of their heart; 
there I will devour them like a lion, 
like an animal of the field would mutilate them.
\verse I will destroy you, \textit{O} Israel; 
who will help you?
\verse Where now \textit{is} your king that he may save you? 
\textit{Where} in all your cities \textit{are} your judges, 
of whom you said, “Give to 
me a king and rulers?”
\verse I gave you a king in my anger, 
and I took \textit{him} in my wrath.
\verse The sin of Ephraim \textit{is} wrapped up; 
his sin \textit{is} concealed.
\verse The labor pains of childbirth come for him; 
he \textit{is} an unwise son 
because \textit{at the} proper time, he does not present himself 
\textit{at the mouth of the womb}.
\verse Should I redeem them from \textit{the power} of Sheol?  
Should I deliver them from death? 
Where \textit{are} your plagues, \textit{O} Death? 
Where \textit{is} your destruction, \textit{O} Sheol? 
Compassion is hidden from my eyes.
\verse Although he may flourish among reeds, 
\textit{the} east wind will come, a wind of Adonai 
rising from \textit{the} desert; 
his fountain will dry up, 
his spring will be parched. 
It will plunder his treasury, 
every object of desire.
\verse  Samaria will be guilty, 
because she has rebelled against her God; 
they will fall by \textit{the} sword, 
their children will be dashed to pieces, 
and their pregnant women will be ripped open.

\verseWithHeading{Return to Adonai} Return to Adonai your God, \textit{O} Israel, 
for you have stumbled because of your sin.
\verse Take words with you, 
and return to Adonai. 
Say to him, 
“Take away all guilt; 
accept good, and we will offer 
the fruit of our lips.
\verse Assyria will not save us; 
we will not ride on horses, 
and we will say no more, “Our God,” 
to the work of our hands 
because in you \textit{the} fatherless child finds mercy.
\verse I will heal their disloyalty; 
I will love them freely 
because my anger has turned back 
from them.
\verse I will be like the dew to Israel; 
he will blossom like the lily plant, 
and he will strike his roots like the \textit{trees of} Lebanon.
\verse His new plant shoots will spread out; 
his splendor will be like the olive tree, 
and his scent like the \textit{trees of} Lebanon.
\verse \textit{They will again dwell} in my shadow; 
they will grow grain 
and they will blossom like the plant vine; 
his fame \textit{will be} like the wine of Lebanon.
\verse \textit{O} Ephraim, \textit{what have I to do} with idols? 
I myself have answered and looked after you. 
I am like a luxuriant cypress; 
your fruit comes from me.
\verse Who \textit{is} wise that he can understand these \textit{things}? 
Who is discerning that he knows them? 
The ways of Adonai \textit{are} right, 
and \textit{the} righteous walk in them; 
but transgressors stumble in them.
