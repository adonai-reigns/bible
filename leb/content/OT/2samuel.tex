\verseWithHeading{The Report of Saul’s Death by the Amalekite} \textit{After} the death of Saul, David returned from defeating the Amalekites and he stayed at Ziklag two days.
\verse On the third day, a man came from the camp from \textit{being with} Saul, with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head. \textit{When he came} to David, he fell to the ground and bowed down.
\verse David said to him, “Where did you come from?” He said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”
\verse Then David said to him, “\textit{How did things go}? Please tell me.” He answered, “\textit{When} the army fled from the battle, and many of the people fell; also, Saul and Jonathan his son died.”
\verse Then David asked the young man who \textit{was} reporting to him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan died?”
\verse The young man who \textit{was} reporting to him said, “I merely happened to be on Mount Gilboa. Here Saul \textit{was} leaning on his spear, and look, the chariots and the horsemen \textit{were} getting close to him.
\verse When he turned around and saw me, he called to me, and I said, ‘Here I \textit{am}.’
\verse Then he said to me, ‘Who \textit{are} you?’ And I said to him, ‘I \textit{am} an Amalekite.’
\verse He said to me, ‘Please stand over me and kill me, for convulsions have seized me, even though my life \textit{is still} in me.’
\verse So I stood over him and killed him, for I knew that he could not live after his falling; I took the crown that \textit{was} on his head and \textit{the} bracelet which \textit{was} on his arm; and here, I have brought them to my lord.
\verse David grabbed \textit{at} his clothes and tore them, \textit{as did} all of the men who \textit{were} with him.
\verse Then they mourned and wept and fasted over Saul and Jonathan his son until the evening, \textit{as well} as over the people of Adonai and over the house of Israel because they had fallen by the sword.
\verse Then David said to the young man who \textit{was} reporting to him, “Where \textit{are} you from?” And he said, “I \textit{am} the son of an alien man. I \textit{am} an Amalekite.”
\verse David said to him, “How \textit{is it that} you \textit{were} not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy Adonai’s anointed one?”
\verse Then David called to one of the young men and said to him, “Come near; strike him.” So he struck him down and he died.
\verse David said to him, “Your blood \textit{is} on your head, for your mouth has testified against you by saying, ‘I killed Adonai’s anointed one!’ ”
\verseWithHeading{David Laments Jonathan with the “Song of the Bow”} Then David sang this funeral song over Saul and over Jonathan his son.
\verse And he ordered “The Bow” to be taught to the children of Judah. Look, it \textit{is} written on the scroll of Jashar.
\verse “The glory of Israel \textit{is} on your high places; how \textit{the} mighty have fallen!
\verse Do not tell it in Gath; do not proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon, 
lest the daughters of \textit{the} Philistines rejoice, 
lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.
\verse O mountains of Gilboa, \textit{let there be} no dew or rain upon you 
or on the fields of \textit{grain for} offerings, 
for there the small shield of \textit{the} mighty \textit{was} defiled, 
the small shield of Saul \textit{was} not anointed with oil.
\verse From the blood of \textit{the} slain, from the fat of \textit{the} mighty, 
the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, 
and the sword of Saul did not return \textit{without effect}.
\verse Saul and Jonathan \textit{were} beloved and pleasant in their lives 
and \textit{were} not separated in their death. 
They \textit{were} swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.
\verse O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, 
the one who clothed you with crimson, 
the one who \textit{adorned your clothing with golden ornaments}.
\verse How \textit{the} mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle; 
Jonathan \textit{lies} slain on your high places.
\verse \textit{I am distressed} over you, my brother Jonathan. 
you \textit{were} very dear to me; 
your love \textit{was} more wonderful to me than the love of women.
\verse How \textit{the} mighty have fallen and the weapons of warfare perished.”

\begin{biblechapter} % 2 Samuel 2
\verseWithHeading{David Moves to Hebron} It happened after this that David inquired of Adonai, saying, “Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah?” And Adonai said to him, “Go up.” David asked, “Where shall I go up?” And he said, “To Hebron.”
\verse So David went up there \textit{along with} his two wives, Ahinoam \textit{from Jezreel} and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
\verse Also, David brought up his men who \textit{were} with him, each \textit{with} his household, and they settled in the towns of Hebron.
\verseWithHeading{David Anointed King over Judah at Hebron} Then the men of Judah came, and they anointed David there as king over the house of Judah, and they told David, “The men of Jabesh-Gilead buried Saul.”
\verse So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead and said to them, “May you be blessed by Adonai because you did this loyal love with your lord, with Saul, and you buried him.
\verse Now may Adonai show loyal love and faithfulness with you. I will also show the good with you that you have done in this matter.
\verse So then, let your hands be strong and \textit{be valiant}, for your lord Saul \textit{is} dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me as king over them.”
\verseWithHeading{Ish-Bosheth over Israel} But Abner the son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over \textit{to} Mahanaim.
\verse He made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, and over Israel, all of it.
\verse Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul \textit{was} forty years old when he became king over Israel and he reigned two years; however, the house of Judah \textit{followed} David.
\verse The number of days that David was king over Hebron, over the house of Judah, \textit{was} seven years and six months.
\verseWithHeading{War between Judah and Israel} Abner the son of Ner and the servants of Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
\verse Then Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out, and they met at the pool of Gibeon. The one group sat on one side of the pool, and the other sat on the other side.
\verse Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men come up and fight in our presence.” And Joab said, “Let them come up.”
\verse So they came forward and passed by in number: twelve for Benjamin and for Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David.
\verse Then each seized his \textit{opponent} by the head and \textit{each thrust} his sword in the side of his opponent, so they fell together. So they called the name of that place Helkath Hazzurim, which \textit{is} in Gibeon.
\verse Then the battle \textit{became increasingly fierce} on that day, and Abner and the men of Israel \textit{were} defeated before the servants of David.
\verse The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel \textit{was} swift with his feet as one of the gazelles which \textit{is} in the open field.
\verse So Asahel pursued Abner, and he did not turn aside to the right or to the left from going after Abner.
\verse Abner turned around and said, “\textit{Are} you this Asahel?” And he said, “Yes.”
\verse Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right or to your left; seize for yourself one of the young men, and take his belongings for yourself.” But Asahel \textit{was} not willing to turn aside from him.
\verse So Abner said to Asahel \textit{once again}, “\textit{For your own sake}, turn aside \textit{from following me}. Why should I strike you down to the ground? How could I \textit{show my face} to Joab your brother?”
\verse But he refused to turn away, so Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of the spear, and the spear went out of his back. He fell there and he died \textit{on the spot}. \textit{Then} all who came to the place where Asahel fell and died \textit{just} stood there.
\verse So Joab and Abishai pursued Abner \textit{when} the sun went down. And they came to the hill \textit{country} of Ammah, which \textit{is} \textit{before Giah} \textit{on} the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
\verse The descendants of Benjamin rallied after Abner, and they became as one fighting group and stood on the top of a certain hill.
\verse Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Will \textit{the} sword devour forever? Do you not know that \textit{there} will be bitterness in the end? \textit{How long} will you not tell the people to turn \textit{away from pursuing} their brothers?”
\verse Joab said, “\textit{As God lives}, for if you had not spoken, the people would surely have gone up in the morning, each \textit{one of them} \textit{from following after} his brother.”
\verse Then Joab blew on the trumpet and all the people stopped, and they no longer pursued after Israel, and they did not fight with them again.
\verse Then Abner and his men went through the Arabah all that night, and they crossed over the Jordan. They went all the forenoon and came to Mahanaim.
\verse After Joab returned from \textit{pursuing} Abner, he gathered all the people; nineteen of the servants of David \textit{were} missing \textit{along} with Asahel.
\verse The servants of David had killed some of the Benjaminites among the men of Abner; three hundred and sixty men had died.
\verse Then they picked up Asahel and buried him in the grave of his father, which \textit{was at} Bethlehem. Joab and his men went all that night :}|S|arriving} in Hebron at first light}.

\begin{biblechapter} % 2 Samuel 3
\verseWithHeading{The House of David Grows Stronger} The battle \textit{was} prolonged between the house of Saul and the house of David, but David :}|S|was} growing stronger and stronger} while the house of Saul :}|S|was} becoming weaker and weaker}.
\verse And sons \textit{were} born to David in Hebron; his firstborn \textit{was} Amnon by Ahinoam \textit{from Jezreel}.
\verse His second \textit{was} Kileab by Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; the third \textit{was} Absalom the son of Maacah, \textit{who was} the daughter of Talmai the king of Geshur.
\verse The fourth \textit{was} Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth \textit{was} Shephatiah the son of Abital.
\verse The sixth \textit{was} Ithream by Eglah the wife of David. These \textit{were} born to David in Hebron.
\verse As the war between the house of Saul and the house of David was \textit{continuing}, Abner was strengthening himself in the house of Saul.
\verse Saul had had a concubine, and her name \textit{was} Rizpah the daughter of Aiah. Then \textit{Ish-Bosheth} said to Abner, “Why \textit{did you have sex with} my father’s concubine?”
\verse \textit{Abner became very angry} at the words of Ish-Bosheth, and he said, “\textit{Am} I the head of a dog which \textit{is} for Judah today? Do I not continue to show loyal love with the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends? I have not let you fall into the hands of David, yet you have \textit{accused me of sin with this woman} today.
\verse Thus \textit{may God punish Abner}, \textit{if I do not accomplish what Adonai has sworn to David};
\verse \textit{specifically,} to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah from Dan to Beersheba!”
\verse And \textit{Ish-Bosheth} was no longer able to \textit{answer} Abner \textit{because he feared him}.
\verseWithHeading{Abner Pledges Support for David} Abner sent messengers to David \textit{where he was}, saying, “To whom does the land \textit{belong}? \textit{Make your covenant with me}! Look, my hand \textit{is} with you to bring all of Israel over to you!”
\verse He said, “Good. \textit{I will make a covenant with you}. I am asking only one thing from you: You shall not see my face unless you bring Michal the daughter of Saul when you come to see \textit{me}.”
\verse Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth the son of Saul, saying, “Give \textit{me} my wife Michal whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of \textit{the} Philistines.”
\verse So Ish-Bosheth sent and took her from \textit{her} husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish.
\verse But her husband went with her, \textit{weeping all along} after her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go \textit{and} return.” So he returned.
\verse The word of Abner \textit{came to} the elders of Israel, saying, “\textit{For quite some time} you were seeking David as king over you.
\verse So then, bring it about, because Adonai had said to David, “Through the hand of David my servant \textit{I am about} to save my people Israel from the hand of \textit{the} Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.”
\verse Abner also spoke \textit{privately to Benjamin}. Abner also went \textit{to speak to David} in Hebron, all that \textit{was} good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of all the house of Benjamin.
\verse Then Abner came to David in Hebron and with him \textit{were} twenty men. David had prepared a feast for Abner and for the men who \textit{were} with him.
\verse And Abner said to David, “Let me get up and go and gather all of Israel to my lord the king, that they may \textit{make a covenant} with you so you can reign over all which your soul desires.” So David dismissed Abner, and he left in peace.
\verse And look, the servants of David and Joab came from the raid, and they brought much plunder with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had dismissed him, and he had gone in peace.
\verse When Joab and all the army that \textit{was} with him came, they told Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he sent him away, and he left in peace.”
\verseWithHeading{Joab Assassinates Abner} Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Abner came here to you? Why have you dismissed him that he \textit{actually went away}?
\verse You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you. He came to learn about your going out and coming \textit{in} and to know all which you \textit{are} doing.”
\verse Then Joab went out from David, and he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from Bor Hasirah, but David did not know \textit{it}.
\verse When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate to speak with him in private. Then he struck him in the stomach there and he died, \textit{for he had shed the blood of Asahel his brother}.
\verse When David heard this afterwards, he said: “I and my kingdom \textit{are} innocent \textit{before Adonai} forever \textit{for} the blood of Abner the son of Ner.
\verse May \textit{the blood} come down on the head of Joab and all the house of his father. \textit{May the house of Joab never lack} \textit{one with} a bodily discharge or \textit{one with} leprosy or \textit{one who} grasps the distaff or \textit{one who} falls by the sword or \textit{one who is} lacking food.”
\verse So Joab and Abishai, his brother, killed Abner because he had killed Asahel, their brother, at Gibeon in the battle.
\verse David said to Joab and to all the people who \textit{were} with him, “Tear your clothing and put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner.” Now King David \textit{was} following after the bier.
\verse And they buried Abner at Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.
\verse The king sang a lament for Abner and said, “Should Abner have died the death of a fool?
\verse Your hands \textit{were} not tied and your feet \textit{were} not in contact with bronze fetters. You have fallen as one who falls before sons of wickedness.” Then \textit{all the people wept over him again}.
\verse Then all the people came to give David food. Still on that day, David swore, “\textit{May God punish me} if I taste food or anything before the sun goes down.”
\verse All the people noticed, and it \textit{was} good in their eyes, as everything that the king did \textit{was} good in the eyes of all the people.
\verse Then all the people and all of Israel realized on that day that \textit{the king had not desired} to kill Abner the son of Ner.
\verse Then the king said to his servants, “Did you not realize that a prince and a great man has fallen today in Israel?
\verse I \textit{am} weak today even though anointed king, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, \textit{are} crueler than I \textit{am}. May Adonai pay them back for doing wickedness according to their \textit{own} wickedness.”
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % 2 Samuel 4
\verseWithHeading{Ish-Bosheth is Assassinated} When the son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, \textit{his courage failed} and all of Israel \textit{was} horrified.
\verse Two of the men, commanders of the raiding bands, were \textit{for} the son of Saul. The name of one \textit{was} Baanah, and the name of the other \textit{was} Recab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the descendants of Benjamin; also, Beeroth \textit{was} regarded \textit{as belonging} to Benjamin.
\verse The Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and they are resident aliens there until this day.
\verse (Now Jonathan the son of Saul had a son who \textit{was} crippled in the feet. He \textit{was} five years old when the message of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse had picked him up and fled. It happened that as she \textit{was} hurrying away to flee, he fell and became crippled. His name \textit{was} Mephibosheth.)
\verse When the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Recab and Baanah, set out, they came at the heat of the day to the house of Ish-Bosheth while \textit{he \textit{was} taking a noontime rest}.
\verse They came as far as the middle of the house \textit{as if} takers of wheat, and they struck him in the stomach. Then Recab and Baanah his brother escaped.
\verse When they had come \textit{into} the house, he \textit{was} lying on his couch \textit{in his bedchamber}, and they attacked him and killed him. Then they \textit{beheaded him}, and they took his head and went on the way of the Arabah all night.
\verse They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron, and they said to the king, “Here \textit{is} the head of Ish-Bosheth, the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life. Adonai has given to my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and on his offspring.”
\verse Then David answered Recab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and he said to them, “\textit{As Adonai lives}, who redeemed my soul from all trouble,
\verse when the \textit{one} who told me, “Look, Saul \textit{is} dead,” \textit{thought that he \textit{was} bringing good news}, I seized him and killed him at Ziklag, which \textit{was} as my giving the news \textit{back} to him.
\verse \textit{How much more} when wicked men kill a righteous man in his house, on his bed! So then, shall I not seek his lifeblood from your hand, so that I may destroy you from the earth?”
\verse Then David commanded the young men, and they killed them, and they cut off their hands and their feet, and they hung \textit{them} at the pool at Hebron, but the head of Ish-Bosheth they took and buried in the grave of Abner at Hebron.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % 2 Samuel 5
\verseWithHeading{David Anointed as King over All of Israel} So all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and they said, “Here we \textit{are}, \textit{we are your flesh and blood}.
\verse \textit{For some time}, when Saul was king over us, \textit{you were leading Israel in and out}. Adonai had said to you, ‘You shall be the shepherd of my people Israel, and you will be the leader over Israel.’ ”
\verse All the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David \textit{made a covenant} with them at Hebron in the presence of Adonai; then they anointed David as king over Israel.
\verse David \textit{was} thirty years old when he began to reign; he reigned forty years.
\verse He reigned over Judah at Hebron \textit{for} seven years and six months; and he reigned over all Israel and Judah at Jerusalem \textit{for} thirty-three years.
\verseWithHeading{The Capture and Growth of Jerusalem} The king and his men went to Jerusalem, to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land. They said to David, “You will not come here, for even the blind and the lame can turn you back, saying, ‘David cannot come here.’ ”
\verse David captured the fortress of Zion, the city of David.
\verse David had said, “On that day \textit{when we attack the Jebusites}, one must attack the lame and the blind, \textit{those} who hate the soul of David, by \textit{means of} the water supply.” For thus the blind and the lame would say, “He cannot come into the house.”
\verse David occupied the fortress and called it the city of David. And David built all around \textit{it} from the Millo and \textit{inward}.
\verse David \textit{continued growing stronger and stronger}, and Adonai the God of hosts \textit{was} with him.
\verse So Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, \textit{along with} cedar trees and \textit{craftsmen skilled in wood and in stone masonry}, and they built a house for David.
\verse David realized that Adonai had established him as king over Israel and that he had exalted his kingdom because of his people Israel.
\verse David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he came from Hebron, and more sons and daughters \textit{were} born to him.
\verse These \textit{are} the names of the ones born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon;
\verse Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia;
\verse Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet.
\verseWithHeading{War with the Philistines} When \textit{the} Philistines heard that they had anointed David as king over Israel, all \textit{the} Philistines went up to seek David, but David heard and went down to the stronghold.
\verse Now \textit{the} Philistines had come, and they spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
\verse And David inquired of Adonai, saying, “Shall I go up to the Philistines? Will you give them into my hands?” Adonai said to David, “Go up, for \textit{I will certainly give} \textit{the} Philistines into your hand.”
\verse So David came to Baal Perazim and defeated them there; and David said, “Adonai has burst through my enemies before me like the bursting of water.” Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
\verse They had left their idols there, so David and his men carried them away.
\verse \textit{Once again} \textit{the} Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
\verse So David inquired of Adonai, but he said, “You shall not go up. \textit{Rather,} go around to their rear and come to them from opposite the balsam trees.
\verse \textit{And it shall be} that when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then pay attention, for then Adonai has gone out before you to strike down the army of \textit{the} Philistines.”
\verse So David did thus, just as Adonai had commanded him, and he struck down \textit{the} Philistines from Geba \textit{all the way} to Gezer.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % 2 Samuel 6
\verseWithHeading{David Brings the Ark of Adonai to Jerusalem} David again gathered all the chosen men in Israel, thirty thousand.
\verse David got up and went and all the people who \textit{were} with him, from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God which \textit{is} called the name, the name of Adonai of hosts, \textit{upon which the cherubim sit}.
\verse They loaded the ark of God on a new utility cart, and they carried it from the house of Abinadab, which \textit{was} on the hill. Now Uzza and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, \textit{were} driving the new utility cart along.
\verse So they brought it out from the house of Abinadab, which \textit{was} on the hill with the ark of God, and Ahio \textit{was} going before the ark.
\verse Now David and all the house of Israel \textit{were} dancing before Adonai, with all kinds of \textit{musical instruments made from} ash trees, and with zithers, harps, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.
\verse When they came to the threshing floor of Nakon, Uzza reached out to the ark of God and took hold of \textit{it}, because the oxen had stumbled.
\verse \textit{Then the anger of Adonai was kindled} against Uzza, and God struck him down there because of the indiscretion, and he died there beside the ark of God.
\verse \textit{David was angry} because Adonai had burst out against Uzza, and he called that place Perez-Uzza until this day.
\verse But David feared Adonai on that day and said, “How can the ark of Adonai come to me?”
\verse However, David \textit{was} not willing to bring the ark of Adonai to himself, to the city of David, so David caused it to turn \textit{to} the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
\verse So the ark of Adonai remained \textit{in} the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite \textit{for} three months, and Adonai blessed Obed-Edom and all his household.
\verse It \textit{was} told to King David, “Adonai has blessed the household of Obed-Edom and all that \textit{is} his because of the ark of God.” So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the city of David with jubilation.
\verse It happened \textit{that} when the carriers of the ark of Adonai had marched six steps that he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.
\verse Now David \textit{was} dancing with all \textit{his} might before Adonai, and David \textit{was} wearing a linen ephod.
\verse So David and all the house of Israel \textit{were} bringing up the ark of Adonai with shouts of joyful acclaim and with the sound of the trumpet.
\verse It happened that when the ark of Adonai came \textit{into} the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked down through the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before Adonai, and she despised him in her heart.
\verse They brought the ark of Adonai and set it in its place in the middle of the tent which David had pitched for it. Then David offered up burnt offerings and fellowship offerings in the presence of Adonai.
\verse When David had finished from the sacrificing of the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Adonai of hosts.
\verse Then he distributed to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, from man to woman, to each: one ring-shaped piece of bread, one cake of dates, and one cake of raisins; and all the people went each to his house.
\verse When David returned to bless his household, Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David. She said, “How the king of Israel honored himself today \textit{by uncovering himself} before the eyes of the maids of his servants, \textit{as the total exposure of a worthless one}.”
\verse So David said to Michal, “\textit{In the} presence of Adonai who chose me \textit{over} your father and \textit{over} his household, to appoint me \textit{as} leader over the people of Adonai, over Israel, I have celebrated before Adonai.
\verse I will demean myself again more than this, and I will be abased in my eyes, but with the maids whom you mentioned, with them I will be honored.”
\verse So for Michal the daughter of Saul, she had no child until the day of her death.

\begin{biblechapter} % 2 Samuel 7
\verseWithHeading{Adonai Makes a Covenant with David} It happened that the king settled in his house. (Now Adonai had given rest to him from all his enemies all around.)
\verse And the king said to Nathan the prophet, “Look, please, I \textit{am} living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God \textit{is} staying in the middle of the tent.”
\verse Nathan said to the king, “Go and do all that \textit{is} in your heart, for Adonai \textit{is} with you.”
\verse But it happened \textit{that night}, the word of Adonai came to Nathan, saying,
\verse “Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says Adonai: “\textit{Are} you the one to build for me a house for my dwelling?
\verse For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought up the \textit{Israelites} from Egypt until this day; \textit{rather,} I \textit{was} going about in a tent and in a tabernacle.
\verse In all of my going about among all the \textit{Israelites}, did I speak a word with one of the tribes of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, ‘Why did you not build me a cedar house?’ ” ’
\verse So then, thus you shall say to my servant David, ‘Thus says Adonai of hosts, “I took you from the pasture \textit{from following} the sheep to be a leader over my people, over Israel,
\verse and I have been with you \textit{everywhere you went}. I have cut off all of your enemies from in front of you, and I will make a great name for you, as the name of the great \textit{ones} who \textit{are} on the earth.
\verse I will make a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them so that they can dwell \textit{in their own place}. They will not tremble \textit{any} longer, and the children of wickedness will not afflict them again, as in the former days.
\verse \textit{In the manner that} I appointed judges over my people Israel, I will give you rest from all your enemies. And Adonai declares to you that Adonai will build a house for you.
\verse When your days \textit{are} full and you lie down with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you who will go out from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
\verse He will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.

\verse Therefore you \textit{are} great, my lord Adonai, for there is no one like you, and there \textit{is} no god except you, in all that we have heard with our ears.

\verse You have established your people Israel for yourself as a people forever, and you, O Adonai, have become their God.
\verse So then, Adonai, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do just as you have promised.
\verse Your name shall be great forever, \textit{and they will say}, ‘Adonai of hosts \textit{is} God over Israel’; and the house of your servant David shall be established before you.
\verse For you, O Adonai of hosts, \textit{are} God of Israel! You have revealed to the ear of your servant, ‘I will build a house for you’; therefore your servant \textit{has found courage} to pray this prayer to you.
\verse Now, my Lord Adonai, you alone \textit{are} God, and your words \textit{are} true. You have promised this good to your servant.
\verse So then, be content and bless the house of your servant to be forever in your presence, for you, my Lord Adonai, have spoken, and because of your blessing, may the house of your servant be blessed forever.”

They ravaged all of the \textit{Ammonites} and besieged Rabbah, but David \textit{was} remaining in Jerusalem.
\verse It happened \textit{late one afternoon} \textit{that} David got up from his bed and walked about on the roof of the king’s house, and he saw a woman bathing on her roof. Now the woman \textit{was very beautiful}.
\verse David sent and inquired about the woman, and \textit{someone} said, “\textit{Is} this not Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?”

\verse The woman became pregnant, and she sent and told David, and she said, “I \textit{am} pregnant.”
\verse So David sent to Joab, “Send Uriah the Hittite to me.” So Joab sent Uriah to David.

\verse David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet.” So Uriah went out from the king’s house, and a gift from the king went out after him.
\verse But Uriah slept \textit{at} the entrance of the king’s house with all the servants of his master and did not go down to his house.
\verse They told David, “Uriah did not go down to his house.” David said to Uriah, “\textit{Are} you not coming from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?”

\verse And it happened in the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab, and he sent it by the hand of Uriah.
\verse He had written in the letter, “Put Uriah in the front, in the face of the fiercest fighting, then draw back from behind him so that he may be struck down and die.”
\verse \textit{When Joab was besieging} the city, he put Uriah toward the place which he knew \textit{there were valiant warriors}.

\verse He instructed the messenger, saying, “As you are finishing to speak all the news of the battle to the king,
\verse if the anger of the king rises and he says to you, ‘Why did you go near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from \textit{atop} the wall?
\verse Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerub-bosheth, if not a woman who threw an upper millstone on him from \textit{atop} the wall and he died at Thebez? Why did you go near the wall?’ Then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.’ ”
\verse Then the messenger left, and he came and told David all that Joab had sent him \textit{to say}.
\verse The messenger said to David, “Because \textit{the men overpowered us}, the men came out to us \textit{in} the field, but \textit{we forced them back} to the entrance of the gate.

\verseWithHeading{Nathan Reproves David} So Adonai sent Nathan to David, and he came to him and said, “Two men were in a certain city; one \textit{was} rich and the other \textit{was} poor.
\verse The rich \textit{man} had very many flocks and herds,
\verse but the poor \textit{man} had nothing except for one small ewe lamb which he had bought. He had nurtured her, and she grew up with him and with his children together. She used to eat from his morsel and drink from his cup, and she used to lie in his lap and became like a daughter for him.
\verse And a visitor came to the rich man, but he \textit{was reluctant} to take from his flocks or from his herds to prepare a meal for the traveler when he came to him. So he took the ewe lamb of the poor man and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”
\verse Then \textit{the anger of David was kindled} against the man, and he said to Nathan, “\textit{As Adonai lives}, the man who has done this \textit{deserves to die}!
\verse He shall restore the ewe lamb fourfold because he has done this thing, and because he had no pity.”
\verse Then Nathan said to him, “You \textit{are} the man! Thus says Adonai the God of Israel: ‘I anointed you as king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.
\verse I gave you the household of your master and the women of your master into your lap. I also gave you the house of Israel and Judah; if \textit{that had been too} little, I would have added to you \textit{much more}.
\verse Why have you despised the word of Adonai by doing evil in his eyes? Uriah the Hittite you have struck down with the sword, and his wife you have taken to yourself as wife! You have killed him with the sword of the \textit{Ammonites}!
\verse So then, a sword will not turn away from your house forever, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife!’
\verse Thus says Adonai, ‘Look, I \textit{am} going to raise up evil against you from \textit{within} your house, and I will take your women before your eyes, and I will give them to your neighbor, and he shall sleep with your wives \textit{in broad daylight}.

\verse But because you have \textit{utterly scorned} Adonai in this matter, the son born for you \textit{will certainly die}.”
\verse Then Nathan went to his house, and Adonai struck the child that the wife of Uriah bore for David, and he became ill.
\verse David pleaded \textit{with} God on behalf of the boy and David fasted. He went to spend the night and lay upon the ground.
\verse The elders of his household stood over him to lift him up from the ground, but he \textit{was} not willing, and he did not eat \textit{any} food with them.
\verse It happened on the seventh day that the child died, and the servants of David \textit{were} afraid to tell him that the child \textit{was} dead, for they said, “Look, when the child \textit{was} alive, we spoke to him, but he would not listen to our voice. How can we tell him, ‘The child \textit{is} dead’? He may do \textit{something} evil.”
\verse When David saw that his servants \textit{were} whispering together, he realized that the child \textit{was} dead. Then David said to his servants, “\textit{Is} the child dead?” And they said, “He \textit{is} dead.”
\verse David stood up from the ground and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothing. Then he went \textit{to} the house of Adonai and worshiped, and he went to his \textit{own} house. He asked, so they served him food, and he ate.
\verse Then his servants said to him, “What \textit{is} this thing that you have done? While the child \textit{was} alive, you fasted and wept; \textit{now} that the child has died, you get up and eat food!”
\verse He said, “When the child \textit{was} still alive, I fasted and I wept because I thought, ‘Who knows? Adonai may have mercy on me that the child will live.’
\verse But now he \textit{is} dead. Why \textit{should I be} fasting? \textit{Am} I able to return him again? I \textit{am} going to him, but he cannot return to me.”
\verse David consoled Bathsheba his wife, and he went to her and slept with her. She bore a son, and he called him Solomon, and Adonai loved him.

\verse And Amnon \textit{was so frustrated that he felt ill} because of Tamar his sister, because she \textit{was} a virgin, and it \textit{was} too difficult in Amnon’s eyes to do anything with her.
\verse Now Amnon had a friend whose name \textit{was} Jonadab the son of Shimeah, the brother of David. (Now Jonadab \textit{was} a very crafty man.)
\verse And he said to him, “Why \textit{are} you so sullen \textit{every morning}, O son of the king? Will you not tell me?” And Amnon said to him, “I \textit{am} in love with Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.”
\verse Then Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and appear ill. If your father comes to see you, you shall say to him, ‘Please let Tamar my sister come and give me food to eat, and let her prepare the food before my eyes, in order that I may see it and eat from her hand.’ ”
\verse So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill, and the king came to see him. Amnon said to the king, “Please let Tamar my sister come, and let her bake two cakes before my eyes that I may eat from her hand.”
\verse So David sent to the house for Tamar, saying, “Please go to the house of Amnon your brother and prepare food for him.”
\verse Tamar went to the house of Amnon her brother. Now he \textit{was} lying down, and she took the dough and kneaded \textit{it} and made cakes before his eyes, and she baked the cakes.
\verse Then she took the pan and poured it out before him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said, “Let all \textit{the} men go out from me.” So all \textit{the} men went out from him.
\verse Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food \textit{to} the private room that I may eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them to Amnon her brother in the private room.
\verse When she brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister!”
\verse Then Tamar said to him, “No, my brother! Do not force me, for such a thing has not been done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing!
\verse As for me, where should I take my disgrace? You will be as one of the fools in Israel. So please, speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.”
\verse But he \textit{was} not willing to listen to her voice. He \textit{was} stronger than she, and he forced her and lay with her.
\verse Then Amnon hated her \textit{very deeply}, for the hatred with which he hated her \textit{was} greater than \textit{the} love with which he had loved her. So Amnon said to her, “Get up \textit{and} go.”
\verse She said to him, “No, because this evil in sending me away \textit{is} greater than the other you have done to me.” But he \textit{was} not willing to listen to her.
\verse Then he called his young man who \textit{was} serving him and said, “Please send this woman from me to the outside, and bolt the door behind her!”
\verse Now there \textit{was} a long-sleeved robe on her, for so they clothed the daughters of the king who \textit{were} virgins, in robes. His servant put her outside, and he bolted the door behind her.
\verse Tamar put ashes on her head, and she tore the long-sleeved robe which \textit{was} on her. She put her hand on her head, and \textit{she went away, crying out as she went}.
\verse Absalom her brother said to her, “\textit{Was} Amnon your brother with you? But now, my sister, be quiet; he \textit{is} your brother. \textit{Do not take this matter to heart}.” So Tamar remained a desolate woman in the house of Absalom her brother.
\verseWithHeading{Absalom Kills Amnon} Now King David heard all these things, and \textit{he became very angry}.
\verse Absalom did not speak with Amnon \textit{either bad or good}, for Absalom hated Amnon \textit{over the matter when} he raped Tamar his sister.
\verse \textit{About two full years later}, Absalom’s shearers were in Baal Hazor, which \textit{is} near Ephraim, and Absalom summoned all the sons of the king.
\verse Then Absalom went to the king and said, “Look, here \textit{are} your servant’s shearers; please let the king and his servants go with your servant.
\verse The king said to Absalom, “No my son, not all of us shall go, so that we not be a burden to you.” And he urged him, but he \textit{was} not willing to go, but he blessed him.
\verse So Absalom said, “But \textit{will you} not let Amnon my brother go with us?” And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”
\verse But Absalom pressed him, so he sent Amnon with him and all of the sons of the king.
\verse Absalom commanded his servants, saying, “Please watch. At the moment the heart of Amnon \textit{is} \textit{tipsy} with wine, then I shall say to you, ‘Strike Amnon down,’ and you shall kill him! Don’t be afraid. \textit{Is} it not I myself who has commanded you? Be courageous and be \textit{valiant!}
\verse So Absalom’s servants did to Amnon just as Absalom commanded, and all the sons of the king got up, and each mounted his mule and fled.
\verse \textit{While they were on the way}, the message came to David, “Absalom has killed all the sons of the king, and not one of them \textit{was} left.”
\verse Then the king rose and tore his garments, and he lay on the ground, and all his servants standing by \textit{were} tearing their garments.
\verse Then Jonadab the son of Shimeah, the brother of David, responded and said, “My lord should not think that all the young men, the sons of the king, \textit{are} dead, because only Amnon \textit{is} dead. \textit{Absalom was talking about it}, as it was being determined from the day he raped Tamar his sister.
\verse So then, let not my lord the king set his heart on this matter, thinking, ‘All the sons of the king \textit{are} dead,’ for only Amnon alone \textit{is} dead.”
\verseWithHeading{Absalom Flees} So Absalom fled, and the young man who \textit{was} keeping watch lifted up his eyes and saw, and there were many people coming from the road behind him from the side of the mountain.

\verse When he finished speaking, look, the sons of the king came and they lifted up their voice and wept. Also, the king and all his servants wept a very great weeping.
\verse Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, the king of Geshur. \textit{David} mourned over his son \textit{day after day}.
\verse But Absalom had fled and went \textit{to} Geshur, and he \textit{was} there three years.

We will also wipe out the heir,’ and so they would put out my embers which remain, by not preserving for my husband a name and a remnant on the face of the earth.”
\verse Then the king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I myself will give the command concerning you.”
\verse The Tekoite woman said to the king, “On me, my lord the king, \textit{is} the guilt, and on the house of my father, but the king on his throne \textit{is} innocent.”
\verse The king said, “\textit{Whoever} has spoken to you, bring him to me, and he will not touch you again.”
\verse Then she said, “Please may the king remember Adonai your God, \textit{to prevent the increase of blood avengers who kill}, \textit{so that they} not wipe out my son.” He said, “\textit{As Adonai lives}, surely not one hair shall fall from your son to the ground.”
\verse The woman said, “Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.” And he said, “Speak.”
\verse The woman said, “But why have you plotted like this against the people of God? By speaking this word, he is guilty not to bring back his banished one.
\verse For \textit{we must certainly die}, and \textit{we are} as the waters spilled to the ground which cannot be gathered. God will not take a life but devises plans for a banished person not to be cast out from him.
\verse Now I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, because the people made me afraid, and your servant thought, ‘I will speak to the king, perhaps the king will grant the request of his servant.
\verse For the king will listen, to deliver his servant from the hand of the man \textit{who seeks} to destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.’
\verse Your servant also thought, ‘May the word of my lord the king \textit{bring rest}, for as an angel of God, so \textit{is} my lord the king, \textit{to sense what is good and what is bad}.’ May Adonai your God be with you.”
\verse The king answered and said to the woman, “Please do not withhold from me a thing which I \textit{am} about to ask you.” The woman said, “Please let my lord the king speak.”
\verse The king asked, “\textit{Was} the hand of Joab with you in all of this?” The woman answered and said, “\textit{As your soul lives}, my lord the king, surely \textit{one cannot} go to the right or to the left from all that my lord the king has spoken. Yes, your servant Joab himself commanded me, and he put all of these words in the mouth of your servant.
\verse In order \textit{to change the situation}, your servant Joab did this thing. But my lord \textit{has} wisdom, as the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all that \textit{is} on the earth.”
\verse Then the king said to Joab, “Look, please, I will grant this thing. Go and bring back the young man Absalom.”
\verse Joab fell with his face to the ground and did obeisance. And he blessed the king, and he said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, \textit{in} that the king has granted the request of his servant.”
\verseWithHeading{Absalom Returns to Jerusalem} Then Joab got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
\verse The king said, “Let him go over to his house, and he may not see my face.” So Absalom went over to his house, and did not see the face of the king.
\verse As far as Absalom, there was not a more handsome man in all of Israel to admire so much; from the sole of his foot up to his crown, there was no physical defect on him.
\verse When he shaved his head, it would happen \textit{every year}, which he did because \textit{it was} heavy on him, he would shave it off and weigh the hair of his head: two hundred shekels \textit{by the king’s weight}.
\verse Three sons \textit{were} born to Absalom and one daughter, whose name \textit{was} Tamar. She \textit{was} a woman beautiful of appearance.
\verse Absalom lived in Jerusalem \textit{two full years}, but he did not see the face of the king.
\verse So Absalom sent for Joab, \textit{in order that he} send him to the king, but he was not willing to go to him. He sent again a second \textit{time}, but he \textit{was} not willing to go.
\verse So he said to his servants, “Look at the tract of land of Joab \textit{next to mine}, for he has barley plants there. Go, set it ablaze with fire.” So the servants of Absalom set the tract of land ablaze with fire.
\verse Then Joab got up and went to Absalom, to the house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my tract of land ablaze with fire?”
\verse Absalom said to Joab, “Look, I have sent to you, saying, ‘Come here that I may send you to the king to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I \textit{were} still there.” ’ So then, let me see the face of the king; if there \textit{is} guilt in me, then let him kill me.”
\verse So Joab went to the king and he told him. Then he summoned Absalom, and he came to the king, and he bowed down to him with his face to the ground before the king. Then the king kissed Absalom.

\verseWithHeading{Absalom Leads a Rebellion} It happened afterward that Absalom made himself a chariot with horses and fifty men running before him.
\verse Absalom used to rise early in the morning, and he stood \textit{beside} the road \textit{at} the gate; \textit{anyone} who had a legal dispute to bring to the king for judgment Absalom would call to him and say, “\textit{Where are you from?}” And he would say, “Your servant \textit{is} from one of the tribes of Israel.”
\verse Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your case \textit{is} good and right, but for you there is no hearing with the king.”
\verse Then Absalom would say, “\textit{Oh, that someone would} appoint me as judge in the land, that \textit{anyone} might come to me who had a legal dispute or a case, and I would give him justice.”
\verse It happened whenever anyone drew near to do obeisance to him, that he would stretch his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.
\verse Absalom did like this to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel.
\verse It happened at the end of four years \textit{that} Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow which I have made to Adonai in Hebron,
\verse for your servant made a vow while I \textit{was} staying in Geshur in Aram, saying, ‘\textit{If Adonai will indeed let me return} to Jerusalem, then I will worship Adonai.’ ”
\verse Then the king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he got up and went to Hebron.
\verse Then Absalom sent scouts throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “When you hear the sound of the trumpet, you shall shout ‘Absalom has become king in Hebron!’ ”
\verse Two hundred men from Jerusalem went with Absalom as invited guests, going in their innocence as they did not know anything.
\verse Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, the advisor of David, from his city Giloh, while he offered the sacrifices. The conspiracy \textit{grew in strength}, and the people \textit{were} going and \textit{increasing} with Absalom.
\verseWithHeading{David Flees from Jerusalem} Then the messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.”
\verse Then David said to all his servants who \textit{were} with him in Jerusalem, “Get up and let us flee, for there will be no escape for us from Absalom! Hurry to go, otherwise he will come quickly and overtake us! And he will bring disaster on us and evil! He will attack the city with the edge of the sword!”
\verse Then the servants of the king said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king chooses, \textit{your servants are ready to act}!”
\verse The king went out with all his household \textit{following him}, but the king left behind ten concubines to look after the house.
\verse So the king went out with all the people \textit{following him}, and they stopped \textit{at the last house}.
\verse All his servants \textit{were} passing \textit{by him}: all of the Kerethites and all of the Pelethites and all of the Gittites—six hundred men \textit{who had followed him} from Gath—passing \textit{before the king}.
\verse The king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why \textit{are} you also coming with us? Return and stay with the king, for you \textit{are} a foreigner; moreover, you \textit{are} an exile. \textit{You \textit{are} far from your place}.
\verse Yesterday when you came and \textit{today}, I have caused you to wander by going with us. Now I \textit{am} going to where I \textit{am} going; return and let your brothers return. \textit{May} loyal love and faithfulness \textit{be} with you.”
\verse But Ittai answered the king and said, “\textit{As Adonai lives} and \textit{my lord the king lives}, surely in the place wherever my lord the king shall be, if for death or if for life, surely there your servant will be.”
\verse Then David said to Ittai, “Go and pass over.” So Ittai the Gittite passed over and all his men and all of the little children who \textit{were} with him.
\verse All of the land \textit{was} weeping \textit{with} a loud voice as all the people \textit{were} passing by and the king \textit{was} crossing through the Wadi Kidron, and all the people \textit{were} passing \textit{on the road to the wilderness}.
\verseWithHeading{The Priests Offer Sacrifices for David} Suddenly Zadok \textit{was} there, and all of the Levites with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set the ark of God down, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people passed out of the city.
\verse The king said to Zadok, “Let the ark of God return to the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Yawheh, he will let me return and let me see him in his dwelling place.
\verse But if he says, ‘I take no pleasure in you,’ then \textit{I am ready}. Let him do to me that which \textit{is} good in his eyes.
\verse Then the king said to Zadok the priest, “\textit{Are} you a seer? Return to the city in peace, \textit{with} Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons with you.
\verse See, I \textit{am} waiting at the fords of the wilderness until a word comes from you all to inform me.”
\verse So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and they remained there.
\verseWithHeading{Hushai Offers to Serve King David} Now David \textit{was} going up on the Ascent of the Olives, \textit{weeping as he went}, with his head covered and going barefoot. All the people who \textit{were} with him each covered their head \textit{and wept as they went}.
\verse Now David \textit{was} told, “Ahithophel \textit{was} among the conspirators with Absalom.” Then David said, “Please frustrate the counsel of Ahithophel, O Adonai.”
\verse It happened that as David \textit{was} coming up to the summit where he used to worship God, suddenly Hushai the Arkite \textit{was} there to meet him. His coat \textit{was} torn and dirt \textit{was} on his head.
\verse David said to him, “If you move on with me, you will be a burden to me,
\verse but if you want to return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I \textit{am} your servant, O king. I used to be a servant of your father, but from then and now I \textit{will be} your servant,’ then you can frustrate the counsel of Ahithophel for me.
\verse \textit{Will} not Zadok and Abiathar the priests \textit{be} with you there? It shall be that all the words you hear from the house of the king you shall tell Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
\verse Look, there with them \textit{are} their two sons, Ahimaaz of Zadok and Jonathan of Abiathar. You shall send to me \textit{by means of them} all the words that you hear.”
\verse So Hushai the friend of David came to the city \textit{as} Absalom was entering Jerusalem.

\verseWithHeading{Ziba Brings Provisions} Now David passed a little from beyond the summit, and suddenly Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth \textit{was} there to meet him \textit{with} a pair of saddled donkeys; on them \textit{were} two hundred loaves of bread and a hundred raisin cakes, \textit{with} a hundred summer fruits and a skin of wine.
\verse The king said to Ziba, “\textit{What do you want to accomplish by bringing these}?” And Ziba said, “The donkeys \textit{are} for the king’s household to ride \textit{on}; the bread and the summer fruit \textit{are} for the young men to eat, and the wine \textit{is} for the faint in the wilderness to drink.
\verse Then the king said, “Where \textit{is} the son of your lord?” And Ziba said to the king, “He \textit{is} living in Jerusalem for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel shall return the kingdom of my father to me.’ ”
\verse The king said to Ziba, “Look, all that \textit{was} Mephibosheth’s is yours.” Ziba said, “I hereby do obeisance; may I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king.”
\verseWithHeading{Shimei Curses David} King David came up to Bahurim and suddenly a man from there \textit{was} coming out from the family of the house of Saul, and his name \textit{was} Shimei the son of Gera. \textit{He was cursing as he came out}.
\verse And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David and at all the people and at all the mighty warriors on his right and on his left.
\verse Shimei said while cursing him, “Go out, go out, \textit{you} \textit{man of bloodshed}, \textit{you} \textit{man of wickedness}.
\verse Adonai has returned on you all the blood of the household of Saul \textit{whom you have supplanted as king}, and Adonai has given the kingship into the hand of Absalom your son. Look, you \textit{are} in disaster for you \textit{are} a man of blood.”
\verse Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.”
\verse The king said, “\textit{What do we have in common}, sons of Zeruiah? If he curses because Adonai has said to him ‘Curse David,’ who can say, “Why have you done this?”
\verse David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Look, my son who came out of my loins \textit{is} seeking my life. Now \textit{as far as} \textit{this} Benjaminite, leave him alone and let him curse, for Adonai has spoken to him.
\verse Perhaps Adonai will look \textit{in my eye} and repay good for me in place of his curse this day.
\verse Then David and his men went on the road, with Shimei going on the side of the hill beside him, \textit{cursing as he went}. He threw stones beside him and threw dust in the air.
\verse When the king and all of the people who were with him arrived, he was weary, so he recovered there.
\verseWithHeading{Hushai Comes to Absalom} Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, had come to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel \textit{was} with him.
\verse When Hushai the Arkite the friend of David came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “\textit{Long} live the king, \textit{long} live the king!”
\verse Absalom said to Hushai, “This \textit{is} your loyal love with your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?”
\verse Then Hushai said to Absalom, “No, rather, whom Adonai and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, to him I will be, and with him I will remain.
\verse \textit{Furthermore}, for whom have I served? \textit{Is} it not in the presence of his son that I have served before your father? \textit{So shall I serve you}!”
\verse Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your advice. What shall we do?”
\verse And Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go to the concubines of your father whom he left behind to watch over the house, then all of Israel will hear that you made yourself odious to your father, and \textit{all of your followers will be motivated}!”
\verse Then they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he went \textit{in} to the concubines of his father before the eyes of all Israel.
\verse The counsel that Ahithophel gave in those days \textit{was} regarded as when a man inquired of the word of God, so all the counsel of Ahithophel \textit{was esteemed} both by David and by Absalom.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % 2 Samuel 17
\verseWithHeading{Hushai Frustrates the Counsel of Ahithophel} Then Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Please let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will set out and pursue after David \textit{tonight}.
\verse I will come upon him while he \textit{is} weary and \textit{weak}. I will startle him, and all of the people who \textit{are} with him will flee. Then I will strike down the king \textit{while} he \textit{is} alone.
\verse Then I will return all the people to you; when all have returned, the man whom you \textit{are} seeking \textit{will be dead}, but all the people will be safe.”
\verse The word \textit{was} right in the eyes of Absalom and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel.
\verse Then Absalom said, “Please call also for Hushai the Arkite, and let us hear \textit{what he has to say} also.”
\verse So Hushai came to Absalom, who said to him, “Shall we do according to this word \textit{that} Ahithophel has spoken? If not, then you tell \textit{us}.”
\verse Then Hushai said to Absalom, “The counsel that Ahithophel gave \textit{is} not good \textit{at this time}.”
\verse Hushai continued, “You know your father and his men, that they \textit{are} mighty warriors and they \textit{are enraged} as a bear robbed of \textit{her} offspring in the field. Your father \textit{is} a man of war, so he will not spend the night with the troops.
\verse Now he has hidden himself in one of the caves or in one of the places. At the moment he falls on them the first time, \textit{whoever hears} the report will say, ‘There has been a defeat among the people who follow after Absalom.’
\verse And he \textit{is} also a \textit{valiant warrior}, whose heart \textit{is} like the heart of the lion. He will \textit{certainly melt} with fear, for all Israel knows that your father \textit{is} a mighty warrior and \textit{those} who \textit{are} with him \textit{are} \textit{valiant warriors}.
\verse I give the advice that all of Israel from Dan to Beersheba should be completely gathered to you, as the sand which \textit{is} on the seashore for abundance, with \textit{you personally} going into the battle.
\verse Then we will come to him in one of the places where he may be found, and we shall come upon him as the dew falls on the ground. He and all the men who are with him will not survive, \textit{not} even one!
\verse \textit{Even} if he withdraws to a city, all Israel will bring up ropes to that city, and they will drag him away to the valley until there \textit{is} not even a pebble to be found.”
\verse Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Arkite \textit{is} better than the advice of Ahithophel.” (Now Adonai had ordained to frustrate the good counsel of Ahithophel in order for Adonai to bring misery upon Absalom).
\verseWithHeading{Hushai Sends Word to David} Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “\textit{Thus and so} Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, but \textit{thus and so} I have advised.
\verse So then, send quickly and tell David, ‘Don’t spend the night at the fords of the wilderness! Moreover, by all means cross over lest the king and all the people who \textit{are} with him be swallowed up.’ ”
\verse Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz \textit{were} staying at En Rogel, so a servant girl used to go and tell them, then they would go and tell King David, for they \textit{were} not able to be seen coming to the city.
\verse But a young man saw them and told Absalom, so both of them went quickly and came to the house of a man at Bahurim. Now he had a well in his courtyard, so they went down there.
\verse Then the woman took and spread a covering over the opening of the well; then she spread out dried grain on it, so nothing was discovered.
\verse When the servants of Absalom came to the woman \textit{at} the house, they said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” And she said to them, “They crossed over the brook of water.” So they searched but could not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.
\verse After they left, they came up from the well and went and told King David. They said to David, “Set out and cross over the water quickly, for thus Ahithophel has advised against you.”
\verse So David and all the people who \textit{were} with him set out, and they crossed over the Jordan until morning light until \textit{there was no one} missing who had not crossed over the Jordan.
\verse When Ahithophel saw that his advice \textit{was} not followed, he saddled the donkey, and he set out and went up to his house in his city. \textit{After he set his house in order}, he hanged himself, and he died and was buried in the tomb of his ancestors.
\verse Now David had come to Mahanaim, and Absalom had crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
\verse Absalom had appointed Amasa in place of Joab over the army. Now Amasa \textit{was} the son of a man whose name \textit{was} Ithra the Israelite, \textit{who had married} Abigail the daughter of Nahash the sister of Zeruiah, the mother of Joab.
\verse Israel and Absalom camped \textit{in} the land of Gilead.
\verse Just as David had arrived in Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the \textit{Ammonites} and Makir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim
\verse brought beds and basins and objects of pottery, as well as wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils,
\verse honey, curds, sheep, cheese, and cattle for David and for the people who \textit{were} with him to eat. For they had thought, “The troops \textit{are} hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.”

\begin{biblechapter} % 2 Samuel 18
\verseWithHeading{Absalom Dies in Battle} Then David mustered the people who \textit{were} with him, and he appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
\verse David sent forth a third of the troops \textit{under the command of Joab}, and a third \textit{under the command of Abishai}, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the remaining third \textit{under the command of Ittai} the Gittite. And the king said to the troops, “I, even I, \textit{will certainly go out} with you.”
\verse Then the troops said, “You will not go out, for \textit{if we must flee}, then \textit{they will not care about us}; even if half of us die, \textit{they will not care about us}, but now, you \textit{are} like ten thousand of us. And so then, \textit{it is} better for us that you be in the city to help.”
\verse The king said to them, “I will do what seems good in your eyes.” So the king stood at the side of the gate \textit{while} all of the troops went out by hundreds and by thousands.
\verse The king ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “With respect to the young man Absalom, \textit{deal} gently for me.” And all the troops heard when the king ordered all of the commanders concerning the matter of Absalom.
\verse The army went out to the field to meet Israel, and the battle was \textit{fought} in the forest of Ephraim.
\verse The army of Israel \textit{was} defeated there before the servants of David, and the defeat there was great on that day: twenty thousand.
\verse The battle there was spreading over the surface of all the land, and \textit{the forest devoured more among the army than} the sword \textit{did} on that day.
\verse Absalom was found in the presence of the servants of David \textit{as he was} riding on the mule. The mule went under the thicket of the great oak tree, and his head \textit{was} caught in the tree. He \textit{was} left hanging between heaven and earth, and the mule which \textit{was} under him went on.
\verse When a certain man saw \textit{it}, he told Joab, and he said, “Look, I saw Absalom hanging in the oak tree!”
\verse Then Joab said to the man who \textit{was} telling him, “Look, \textit{if} you saw, why did you not strike him down to the ground there? \textit{I would have gladly given you} ten pieces of silver and a leather belt.”
\verse The man said to Joab, “\textit{Even if I felt the weight} of a thousand pieces of silver in my palms, I would not have sent my hand against the son of the king, for in our ears the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘Whoever you may be, protect the young man Absalom.’
\verse If I had dealt treacherously against his life, and \textit{there is} not any matter hidden from the king, \textit{you would have presented yourself aloof}.”
\verse Joab said, “No longer will I wait in your presence.” Then he took three spears in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he \textit{was} still alive in the oak tree.
\verse Then ten of the young men who bore the weapons of Joab surrounded \textit{him} and struck and killed Absalom.
\verse Then Joab blew on the trumpet and the troops returned from pursuing after Israel, for Joab kept back the troops.
\verse They took Absalom and they threw him into the large pit in the forest and raised a very great heap of stones over him. Then all of Israel fled, each to his tent.
\verse (Now Absalom had taken and set up for himself in his lifetime a stone pillar that \textit{is} in the valley of the king, because he said, “I have no son in order to remember my name,” and he called the stone pillar by his name. It \textit{is} called the monument of Absalom until this day).
\verse Now Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Please let me run and bring the good news to the king that Adonai has vindicated him from the hand of his enemies.”
\verse Joab said to him, “You \textit{will} not \textit{be} a man \textit{bringing} good news this day! You may bring good news on another day, but today you will not be bringing good news because the king’s son is dead.”
\verse Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen”; then the Cushite bowed down to Joab and ran \textit{off}.
\verse Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok again said to Joab, “\textit{Come what may}, please let me also run after the Cushite.” Joab asked, “Why \textit{are} you wanting to run, my son, when for you there is no \textit{messenger’s reward}?”
\verse “\textit{Come what may}, I want to run.” He said to him, “Run,” so Ahimaaz ran on the road on the plain, and he passed the Cushite.
\verse Now David \textit{was} sitting between the two gates, and the sentinel went up to the roof of the gate by the wall and he lifted up his eyes and watched, and look, a man \textit{was} running by himself.
\verse The sentry called and told the king, and the king said, “If he \textit{is} alone, good news is in his mouth.” \textit{He kept coming closer}.
\verse Then the sentinel saw another man running, so the sentinel called to the gatekeeper and said, “Look, a man running alone.” The king said, “This one also \textit{is} bringing good news.”
\verse The sentinel said, “I \textit{am} seeing \textit{that} the running of the first \textit{is} like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zakok.” The king said, “He \textit{is} a good man; he will come, for good news.”
\verse Then Ahimaaz called and said to the king, “Peace.” He bowed down to the king with his face to the ground, and he said, “May Adonai your God be blessed, who has delivered the men who raised their hand against my lord the king.”
\verse The king said, “\textit{Is} it peace for the young man Absalom?” Ahimaaz said, “I saw the great commotion when Joab the servant of the king sent your servant, but I do not know what \textit{it was all about}.”
\verse Then the king said, “Turn aside, take your place here,” so he turned aside and waited.
\verse Suddenly the Cushite arrived and said, “May my lord the king receive the good news, for Adonai has vindicated you today from the power of all who stood up against you.”
\verse The king said to the Cushite, “\textit{Is} it peace for the young man Absalom?” Then the Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you \textit{to harm you} be like the young man!”
\verse  The king was upset, and he went up to the upper room of the gate and wept. He said as he went, “My son, Absalom, my son, my son, Absalom. \textit{If only} I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son.”

\begin{biblechapter} % 2 Samuel 19
\verseWithHeading{King David Weeps for Absalom} And it was told to Joab that the king \textit{was} weeping and he mourned over Absalom,
\verse so the victory turned to mourning on that day for all the army, because they had heard that day, “The king is grieving over his son.”
\verse The army \textit{came secretly} into the city on that day because the army was disgraced when they fled in the battle,
\verse and because the king had covered his face and cried with a loud voice, “My son, Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son.”
\verse Then Joab came to the king’s house and said, “Today you have humiliated the faces of all of your servants who have saved your life this day, and the life of your sons and your daughters, the life of your wives, and the life of your concubines,
\verse by loving those who hate you and hating those who love you. Indeed, you have made clear this day that you have no \textit{regard for your} commanders or officers, for I have realized today that \textit{were} Absalom alive, and all of us were dead, then \textit{that would} have been right in your eyes!
\verse So then, get up and go out and \textit{speak kindly to your servants}, for I swear by Adonai, if you do not go out, no man will lodge this night with you, and this disaster \textit{will be} greater for you than any disaster that has come upon you from your childhood until now!”
\verse So the king got up and he sat in the gate, and they told all the army, “Look, the king \textit{is} sitting in the gate.” Then all the army came before the king; \textit{whereas} all of Israel had fled, each to his tent.
\verseWithHeading{David Returns from Exile} Then it happened that all the people \textit{were} disputing among all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies, and he saved us from the hand of \textit{the} Philistines, but now he has fled from the land because of Absalom.
\verse Now Absalom whom we anointed \textit{as king} over us has died in the battle; so then, why \textit{are} you taking no action to restore the king?”
\verse Then King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah: ‘Why \textit{are} you last to bring back the king to his house? The talk of all Israel has come to the king in his house.
\verse My brothers, you \textit{are} my bones and you \textit{are} my flesh. Why should you be the last to bring back the king?’
\verse To Amasa you shall say: ‘\textit{Are} you not my bones and my flesh? \textit{May God punish me} if you \textit{are} not the commander of my army before me forever, in place of Joab.’ ”
\verse So he turned the heart of all the men of Judah as one man, and they sent \textit{word} to the king, “Return, you and all your servants.”
\verse Then the king returned and he came to the Jordan; Judah had come to Gilgal to come to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.
\verse Then Shimei the son of Gera, the son of the Benjaminite, who \textit{was} from Bahurim quickly came down with the men of Judah to meet King David,
\verse and a thousand men \textit{were} with him from Benjamin. Too, Ziba the servant of the household of Saul and fifteen of his sons and twenty of his servants \textit{were} with him, and they rushed to the Jordan before the king.
\verse \textit{The crossing took place} to bring the household of the king over and to do good in his eyes. Then Shimei the son of Gera fell before the king when he crossed over the Jordan,
\verse and he said to the king, “May not my lord hold me guilty, and may you not remember how your servant did wrong on the day that my lord the king went out from Jerusalem, by taking it to heart!
\verse For your servant knows that I have sinned; look, I have come this day \textit{as the first} of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.”
\verse Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah responded and said, “Because of this, should not Shimei be put to death, for he cursed the anointed one of Adonai?”
\verse Then David said, “What \textit{is} it to me or to you, sons of Zeruiah, that you should be an adversary today? \textit{Should} anyone be put to death in Israel? Do I not know today that I \textit{am} king over Israel?”
\verse Then the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die,” and \textit{so} the king swore to him.
\verse Now, Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; he had not taken care of his feet nor trimmed his moustache nor washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he came back in peace.
\verse It happened that when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?”
\verse Then he said, “My lord the king, my servant deceived me, for your servant had said, ‘Let me saddle the donkey that I may ride on her and go with the king,’ for your servant \textit{is} lame.
\verse But he slandered against your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king \textit{is} like the angel of God; \textit{do as you see fit.}.”
\verse For there \textit{was no one} in all the house of my father \textit{who were not doomed to death} before my lord the king, but you set your servant among those who eat at your table. Do I have any righteousness any longer except to cry out to the king?”
\verse Then the king said to him, “Why should you speak any more \textit{about} the matter? I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land.”
\verse Then Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him take the whole \textit{thing}, since my lord the king has come \textit{safely} to his house.”
\verse Then Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and crossed with the king over the Jordan to escort him through the Jordan.
\verse Now Barzillai \textit{was} very old, \textit{eighty years old}. Now he had provided the king \textit{with food} while he \textit{was} staying at Mahanaim, for he \textit{was} a very wealthy man.
\verse The king said to Barzillai, “You cross over with me, and I will provide for you \textit{to dwell} with me in Jerusalem.”
\verse Then Barzillai said to the king, “What \textit{are} the days of the years of my life, that I should go with the king to Jerusalem?
\verse I \textit{am} eighty years old today. Can I discern between good and bad? Or can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Or can I still hear the voice of singing men and women? Why should your servant be a burden any longer to my lord the king?
\verse Your servant shall go over the Jordan with the king a little way, but why should the king recompense me with this reward?
\verse Please let your servant return, and let me die in my city in the tomb of my father and my mother. Here \textit{is} your servant Kimham; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him that which \textit{is} good in your eyes.”
\verse The king said, “Let Kimham go over with me, and I will do for him the good in your eyes, and all that you desire of me I will do for you.”
\verse Then all the people crossed over the Jordan, and the king crossed and kissed Barzillai and blessed him; then he returned to his place.
\verse The king went over to Gilgal, and Kimham went over with him. All the people of Judah went over with the king, and half of the people of Israel too.
\verse Suddenly, all the men of Israel \textit{were} coming to the king. They said to the king, “Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen away and brought the king and his household over the Jordan, with all the men of David?”
\verse Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king \textit{is} my close relative! Why \textit{are} you this angry over this matter? \textit{Have we by any means eaten \textit{anything} from the king? Did we take by any means anything that was not ours}?”
\verse Then the people of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, “I have \textit{ten times as much} in the king, moreover in David I have more than you. Why did you treat me with contempt \textit{by not giving me first chance} to bring back my king?” But the words of the men of Judah \textit{were} fiercer than the word of the men of Israel.

\verseWithHeading{Sheba Leads a Revolt} Now a man of wickedness was found there whose name \textit{was} Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite. He blew the horn and said, “There is no share for us in David, and there \textit{is} no inheritance for us in the son of Jesse; each to his tents, O Israel!”
\verse Then all the men of Israel went up from \textit{following} after David, \textit{following instead} after Sheba the son of Bicri, but the men of Judah stuck to their king from the Jordan up to Jerusalem.
\verse David went up to his house in Jerusalem, then the king took the ten concubines whom he had left to look after the house, and he put them \textit{under confinement}. However, he provided for them, but \textit{he did not sleep with them}. So they were confined until the day of their death, like a lifetime of widowhood.
\verseWithHeading{Joab Assassinates Amasa} Then the king said to Amasa, “Summon for me the men of Judah \textit{within} three days, \textit{and be here yourself}.”
\verse So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he tarried more than the appointed time which he had set for him.
\verse Then David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bicri will do us more harm than Absalom. You take the servants of your lord and pursue after him, lest he find fortified cities for himself and escape from us.”
\verse Then the men of Joab, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty warriors went out after him; they went out from Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba the son of Bicri.
\verse They \textit{were} near the big rock that \textit{is} in Gibeon, and Amasa came before them. Joab \textit{was dressed in his military clothing}, \textit{with} a utility belt on him and a sword strapped to his waist in its scabbard. Now he went out, and it fell out.
\verse Then Joab said to Amasa, “Is it peace, O you my brother?” Then the right hand of Joab took hold of the beard of Amasa \textit{as if} to kiss him.
\verse Now Amasa was not on his guard against the sword that \textit{was} in Joab’s hand, and he struck him with it into the stomach, and his entrails poured out to the ground. He did not strike him again, and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bicri.
\verse A young man stood over him, from the young men of Joab, and he said, “Whoever takes delight in Joab and whoever \textit{is} for David, \textit{follow} after Joab.”
\verse Now Amasa \textit{was} wallowing in the blood in the middle of the highway; when the man saw that all the people stood \textit{there}, he turned Amasa over from the highway into the field, and he threw a garment over him because he had seen that all who had come by him had stopped.
\verse After he was removed from the highway, all the men passed by after Joab to pursue after Sheba the son of Bicri.
\verseWithHeading{Wisdom from a Woman under Siege} (He had passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel and Beth Maacah; now all of the Berites had been treated badly, so they also followed after him.)
\verse And they came and besieged him in Abel Beth Maacah. They threw up a siege ramp against the city, and they stood against the ramparts. And all the army who \textit{were} with Joab \textit{were} battering to cause the wall to fall.
\verse Then a wise woman from the city called out, “Listen, listen! Please speak to Joab \textit{to} come near here so that I may speak to you.”
\verse Then he came near to her, and the woman asked, “\textit{Are} you Joab?” And he said, “I \textit{am}.” Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your servant.” He said, “I \textit{am} listening.”
\verse Then she said, “In former times, \textit{they would always say}, ‘By all means, let them inquire in Abel,’ and so they settled things.
\verse I \textit{am} one of the faithful representatives of Israel. You \textit{are} seeking to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow the inheritance of Adonai?”
\verse Then Joab answered and said, “Far be it, far be it from me that I should swallow or I should destroy.
\verse That is not the matter. But a man from the mountains of Ephraim, whose name \textit{is} Sheba the son Bicri, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Give only him to us, and I will depart from the city.” The woman said to Joab, “Look, his head \textit{is} being thrown down to you over the wall.”
\verse The woman went to all of the people with her wise plan, so they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bicri and threw \textit{it} to Joab. Then he blew the horn and dispersed from the city, each to his tent. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
\verse Now Joab \textit{was} over all the army of Israel and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada \textit{was} over the Carites and over the Pelethites.
\verse Adoram \textit{was} over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud \textit{was} the recorder.

\verseWithHeading{The Famine Brings Justice} There \textit{was} a famine in the days of David \textit{for} three years, year after year. And David \textit{inquired of Adonai}, and Adonai said, “The bloodguilt \textit{is} on Saul and on his household, because he killed the Gibeonites.”
\verse So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites \textit{were} not from the \textit{Israelites}; they \textit{were} from the remainder of the Amorites. Now the \textit{Israelites} had sworn to them, but Saul tried to wipe them out in his zeal for the \textit{Israelites} and Judah.
\verse So David asked the Gibeonites, “What can I do for you, and with what can I make amends that you may bless the inheritance of Adonai?”
\verse Then the Gibeonites said to him, “\textit{It is not a matter for us of} silver or gold with Saul or with his household. It is not for us to put to death anyone in Israel.” He asked, “What \textit{are} you saying \textit{that} I should do for you all?”
\verse Then they said to the king, “The man who consumed us and who plotted against us \textit{so that} we were destroyed from existing in all of the territory of Israel,
\verse let seven men from his sons be given over to us, and we will execute them before Adonai in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen one of Adonai.” Then the king said, “I will give them over.”
\verse But the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the sworn oath of Adonai which \textit{was} between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
\verse So the king took two of the sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, namely Armoni and Mephibosheth, and five of the sons of Michal the daughter of Saul whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
\verse He gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they executed them on the mountain in the presence of Adonai, and the seven fell together. Now they were put to death in the days of the harvest, at the beginning of the harvest of barley.
\verse Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took the sackcloth, and she spread it for herself on the rock at the beginning of the harvest until water gushed forth on them from heaven, but she did not allow the birds of heaven to rest on them by day nor the animals of the field by night.
\verse David \textit{was} told about what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
\verse So David left and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the rulers of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth Shan, where \textit{the} Philistines hung them \textit{when} \textit{the} Philistines killed Saul on Gilboa.
\verse He brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there, and they gathered the bones of the executed.
\verse And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin at Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father. They did all that the king had commanded, and afterward God was entreated for the land.
\verseWithHeading{Battles with the Philistines Recounted} There \textit{was} war again for \textit{the} Philistines with Israel, and David and his servants with him went down, and they fought \textit{the} Philistines, and David grew weary.
\verse Now Yishbi in Nob, who \textit{was} among the descendents of Raphah (now the weight of his spearhead \textit{was} three hundredweight of bronze, and he \textit{was} newly armed), said that he would kill David.
\verse But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and he attacked the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “You shall not go out with us any longer to the battle, so that you do not quench the lamp of Israel.”
\verse It happened afterward that there \textit{was} again battle at Gob with \textit{the} Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph who \textit{was} among the descendants of the Raphah.
\verse There \textit{was} again a battle with \textit{the} Philistines at Gob. And Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim, the Bethlehemite, killed Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear \textit{was} like the beam of a weaver.
\verse Once again there \textit{was} battle at Gath, and there \textit{was} \textit{a man of great size}. The fingers of his hand and the toes of his feet \textit{were} six and six, twenty-four in number. He \textit{was} also born to the Raphah.
\verse He taunted Israel but Jonathan the son of Shimei, the brother of David, killed him.

\verseWithHeading{The Victory Song of David} Then David spoke to Adonai the words of this song, on the day Adonai delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
\verse And he said: 
“Adonai \textit{is} my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer.
\verse I take refuge in God, my rock, my shield, and the \textit{strength} of my salvation. 
My stronghold and my refuge, O my savior, you will save me from violence!
\verse I call \textit{upon} Adonai who is praiseworthy, 
and I \textit{am} saved from those who hate me.
\verse For the breaker waves of death engulfed me; 
the currents of chaos overwhelmed me.
\verse The ropes of Sheol entangled me; 
the snares of death confronted me.
\verse In my distress I called \textit{upon} Adonai, and to my God I called. 
He heard my voice from his temple, 
and my cry for help \textit{was} to his ears.
\verse The earth heaved and shook, 
the foundations of heaven trembled and heaved 
because \textit{he was angry}.
\verse Smoke went up from his nostrils and fire from his mouth. 
Burning coals devoured, they burned from him.
\verse He bowed the heavens and came down; 
a very thick cloud \textit{was} under his feet.
\verse He rode upon a cherub and flew; 
he was seen on the wings of the wind.
\verse He put darkness \textit{as} a canopy all around him, 
a collection of \textit{thick rain clouds}.
\verse From the brightness before him 
flamed burning coals of fire.
\verse Adonai thundered from heaven, 
and the Most High \textit{uttered his voice}.
\verse He sent arrows and he scattered them, 
lightning, and he directed them.
\verse Then the channels of water of the sea were exposed, 
the foundations of the world, 
at the rebuke of Yawheh, 
from the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
\verse He sent from a high position \textit{and} took me; 
he drew me from mighty waters.
\verse He delivered me from my strong enemies, 
from those who hate me, for they \textit{were} mightier than I.
\verse They approached me on the day of my disaster, 
but Adonai \textit{was} my support.
\verse He brought me out to a spacious place. 
He delivered me because he delighted in me.
\verse Adonai rewarded me according to my righteousness, 
according to the cleanness of my hands he recompensed me.
\verse For I have kept the ways of Adonai; 
I have not acted wickedly against my God.
\verse For all of his ordinances \textit{were} before me, 
and I did not turn aside from his statutes.
\verse I was blameless before him, 
and I kept myself from my iniquity.
\verse Adonai has recompensed me according to my righteousness, 
according to my cleanness before his eyes.
\verse With the loyal, you act as loyal, 
and with the blameless, you show yourself blameless.
\verse With the pure, you show yourself pure, 
but with the crooked, you appear as a fool.
\verse Humble people you will deliver, 
but your eyes \textit{are} on the haughty, \textit{whom} you bring down.
\verse For you, O Adonai \textit{are} my lamp, 
and Adonai lightens my darkness.
\verse For by you I can run a raid; 
by my God I can leap over a wall.
\verse This God, his way \textit{is} blameless; 
the promise of Adonai \textit{is} flawless. 
He \textit{is} a shield to all who take refuge in him.
\verse For who \textit{is} God apart from Adonai? 
And who \textit{is} a rock apart from our God?
\verse God \textit{is} my strong refuge, 
he has fully opened my way.
\verse He makes my feet like a doe deer, 
and on my high places he has set me.
\verse He trains my hands for the war, 
so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
\verse You have given me the shield of your salvation; 
your willingness to help has made me great.
\verse You have broadened my steps beneath me; 
my ankles have not wobbled.
\verse I pursued those who hate me, and I destroyed them. 
I did not turn back until finishing them.
\verse I wiped them out and I smashed them; 
they did not get up; they fell under my feet.
\verse You have girded me with physical strength for the battle; 
you caused those who rose up against me to kneel under me.
\verse \textit{My enemies you cause to retreat from me}; 
I destroy those who hate me.
\verse They looked out, but there was no deliverer, 
\textit{even} to Adonai, but he did not answer them.
\verse I beat them fine, like the dust of the earth; 
like the mire of the streets, I crushed them, I stamped them down.
\verse You delivered me from the strife of my people; 
you preserved me as the head of the nations. 
A people I had not known served me.
\verse Children of a foreign land came cringing to me; 
\textit{when they heard of me}, they became obedient to me.
\verse Children of a foreign land lost heart 
and came trembling from their strongholds.
\verse Adonai lives! Blessed be my rock! 
May God, the rock of my salvation, be exalted!
\verse God does vengeance for me, 
bringing down peoples under me.
\verse He brings me out from my enemies, 
and from those who rose up against me you lift me up, 
and from men of violence you rescue me.
\verse Therefore I will extol you, Adonai, among the nations! 
I will sing praises to your name!
\verse He makes great salvation \textit{for} his king 
and shows loyal love to his anointed one, David 
and to his descendants forever.”

\verse The God of Israel said to me, the rock of Israel has spoken; ‘He who rules over mankind rules righteously, in the fear of God.
\verse Like the light of \textit{the} morning when the sun rises, shining with no clouds, \textit{bringing} vegetation from the earth apart from rain.’
\verse Yet not so \textit{is} my house with God, for he made an everlasting covenant for me, arranging everything. He has secured all my deliverance, and all my desire he will cause to happen.

\verse And if a man wants to touch them, he must use an iron instrument or the shaft of a spear; then they \textit{are} consumed entirely with fire on the spot.”
\verseWithHeading{David’s Faithful Soldiers} These \textit{are} the names of the mighty warriors who \textit{were} David’s: Josheb-Basshebeth a Tahkemonite \textit{was} chief of three officers; first Adino, whose spear \textit{was} against eight hundred slain on one occurrence.
\verse Next to him Eleazar, the son of Dodo the son of an Ahohite, \textit{was} among the three mighty warriors with David when they defied the Philistines and they gathered there for the battle and the men of Israel withdrew.
\verse He stood up and struck down the Philistines until his hand grew tired and his hand clung to the sword, and Adonai brought about a great victory on that day. Then the army returned back to him only for stripping \textit{the dead}.
\verse Next to him \textit{was} Shamma, the son of Agee the Hararite. When \textit{the} Philistines assembled at Lehi, a plot of the field was there filled with lentils, and the army fled there from the presence of \textit{the} Philistines.
\verse But he took a stand in the middle of the plot of land and defended it. He killed \textit{the} Philistines, and Adonai brought about a great victory.
\verse Then three of the thirty leaders went down and came to David \textit{at the time of the harvest} to the cave of Adullam, while a group of \textit{the} Philistines \textit{were} camping in the valley of \textit{the} Rephaim.
\verse Now at that time, David \textit{was} in the stronghold, and a garrison of \textit{the} Philistines \textit{was} in Bethlehem at that \textit{same} time.
\verse David \textit{said longingly}, “\textit{Oh that someone would bring me a drink} of water from the well of Bethlehem that \textit{is} at the gate.”
\verse So three of the mighty warriors broke into the camp of \textit{the} Philistines, and they drew water from the well of Bethlehem that \textit{was} at the gate, and they carried \textit{it} and brought \textit{it} to David. But he \textit{was} not willing to drink it, but poured it out to Adonai.
\verse He said, “Far be it from me before Adonai that I should do this. \textit{Is this not} the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?” So he \textit{was} not willing to drink it. These things the three mighty warriors did.
\verse Now Abishai the brother of Joab the son of Zeruiah \textit{was} himself the leader of the thirty. He \textit{was} wielding his spear against three hundred slain and \textit{gained a name} among the thirty.
\verse Among the thirty, is it not that he \textit{was} honored and became a commander for them? But he did not come up to the three.

\verse He also killed a good-looking Egyptian man, in whose hand \textit{was} a spear. He went down against him with the staff and snatched the spear from the hand of the Egyptian and killed him with his spear.

\verseWithHeading{David and the Census of the People} Again Adonai \textit{was} angry with Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, “Go count Israel and Judah.”
\verse The king said to Joab, the commander of the army who \textit{was} with him: “Please go about through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba, and count the people that I may know the number of the people.”
\verse Then Joab said to the king, “May Adonai your God increase the people a hundred times \textit{what they are} as the eyes of my lord the king are seeing. But my lord the king, why does he desire this thing?”
\verse But the word of the king prevailed over Joab and over the commanders of the army, so Joab and the commanders of the army went out from before the king to count the people of Israel.
\verse They crossed over the Jordan and camped at Aroer to the south of the city, which \textit{was} in the middle of the wadi of Gad, and up to Jazer.
\verse Then they went to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi. They came to Dan Jaan and around to Sidon
\verse and came to the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went out to the Negev of Judah at Beersheba.
\verse They went about through all the land, and they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
\verse Then Joab gave the number of the counting of the people to the king. Israel \textit{was} eight hundred thousand \textit{valiant warriors} wielding the sword, and the men of Judah \textit{were} five hundred thousand.
\verse The heart of David struck him after he had counted the people, and David said to Adonai, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done! So then, O Adonai, please forgive the guilt of your servant because I have acted very foolishly.”
\verse When David got up in the morning, the word of Adonai came to Gad the prophet, the seer of David, saying,
\verse “Go and speak to David, ‘Thus says Adonai, three things I \textit{am} laying on you; choose for yourself one of them and I will do it to you.’ ”
\verse Then Gad came to David, and he told him and said to him, “Shall seven years of famine in the land come to you? Or three months of your fleeing from your enemies while he \textit{is} pursuing you? Or should there be three days of pestilence in your land? Now consider and decide what I must return to the one who sent me a word.”
\verse Then David said to Gad, “I \textit{am} greatly distressed. Please let us fall into the hand of Adonai, because he \textit{is} great in his compassion; but into the hand of man don’t let me fall.”
\verse Then Adonai sent a plague into Israel from the morning \textit{until the agreed time}, and from the people from Dan to Beersheba, seventy thousand men died.
\verse When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, Adonai regretted about the evil, and he said to the angel who brought destruction among the people, “Enough, now relax your hand.” Now the angel of Adonai \textit{was} at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
\verse David spoke to Adonai when he saw the angel destroying among the people, and he said, “Look, I have sinned and I have done wrong, but these sheep, what did they do? Please let your hand be against me and against the house of my father.”
\verse Then Gad came to David on that same day and said to him, “Go up and erect an altar to Adonai at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”
\verse So David went up according to the word of Gad, as Adonai had commanded.
\verse Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants coming over to him, so Araunah went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground.
\verse Then Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” David said, “To buy from you the threshing floor, to build an altar to Adonai who brought a halt to the plague on the people.”
\verse Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer what \textit{is} good in his eyes. Look, here \textit{are} the cattle for the burnt offering and the threshing sledge and the yokes of the oxen for the firewood.
\verse All of this Araunah hereby gives to the king.” Then Araunah said to the king, “May Adonai your God respond favorably for you.”
\verse Then the king said to Araunah, “No, but \textit{I will certainly buy} it from you for a price; I don’t want to offer to Adonai my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the cattle for fifty shekels of silver.
\verse David built an altar to Adonai there, and he offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then Adonai responded to \textit{his} prayer for the land and brought the plague to a halt from upon Israel.
