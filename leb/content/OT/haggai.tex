\verseWithHeading{The Temple Lies in Ruins} In the second year of King Darius, in the sixth month, on \textit{the} first day, the word of Adonai came \textit{through} Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,
\verse “Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘This people says, “\textit{The time has not come to rebuild the temple of Adonai}.’ ” 
\verse And the word of Adonai came \textit{through} Haggai the prophet, saying,
\verse “\textit{Is it} a time for you yourselves to dwell in your houses that have been paneled \textit{while} this house \textit{is} desolate?”
\verse And so then, thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘\textit{Consider your ways}!
\verse You have sown much but have harvested little. You have eaten without \textit{being} satisfied; \textit{you have drunk without being satiated}; you have worn clothes without \textit{being} warm; the one who earns wages puts it in \textit{a pouch with holes}.’
\verse Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘\textit{Consider your ways}!
\verse Go up the mountain and bring wood and build the house so that I may be pleased with it and honored,’ says Adonai.
\verse ‘You have looked for much, and look! \textit{It came} to little; and \textit{when} you brought \textit{it} home, I blew it \textit{away}. Why?’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts. ‘Because my house \textit{is} desolate and you \textit{are} running each to your own house!
\verse Therefore, because of you \textit{the} heavens have withheld \textit{the} dew and the earth has withheld its produce.
\verse I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the olive oil, on what the soil produces, on human beings and wild animals, and on \textit{all their labor}.’ ”
\verse Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people gave heed to the voice of Adonai their God and to the words of Haggai the prophet, as Adonai their God had sent him, \textit{and the people feared Adonai}.
\verse And Haggai the messenger of Adonai spoke to the people with the message of Adonai, saying, “ ‘I \textit{am} with you’ \textit{declares} Adonai.”
\verse And Adonai stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and did \textit{the} work on the house of Adonai of hosts, their God,
\verse on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of King Darius.

\verseWithHeading{A Promise to Rebuild} In the seventh \textit{month} on the twenty-first day, the word of Adonai \textit{came through} Haggai the prophet, saying,
\verse “Speak now to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
\verse ‘Who among you \textit{is} left that saw this house in its former glory? And how do you see it now? Does it seem like nothing \textit{to you}?
\verse ‘But now take courage, Zerubbabel,’ \textit{declares} Adonai. ‘Take courage, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and take courage, all the people of the land,’ \textit{declares} Adonai. ‘Do the work, because I \textit{am} with you,’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts,
\verse ‘according to \textit{the promise} that \textit{I covenanted} with you when you came out of Egypt. My spirit \textit{is with you}; do not be afraid.’
\verse For thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘Once again, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and dry land.
\verse I will shake all the nations so that the treasure of all the nations will come, and I will fill this house \textit{with} glory,’ says Adonai of hosts.
\verse ‘The silver \textit{is} mine and the gold \textit{is} mine,’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts.
\verse ‘The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,’ says Adonai of hosts, ‘and in this place I will give peace’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts.’ ”
\verse On \textit{the} twenty-fourth \textit{day} of the ninth \textit{month}, in the second year of Darius, the word of Adonai came to the prophet Haggai, saying,
\verse “Thus says Adonai of hosts: ‘Ask now the priests \textit{for} a ruling:
\verse If a man carries consecrated meat in the hem of his garment, and his hem touches bread, or stew, or wine, or olive oil, or any kind of food, will it become holy?’ ” The priests answered, “No.”
\verse Then Haggai said, “If one who is unclean from contact with a corpse touches any of these, will it become unclean?” The priests answered, “Yes, it will be become unclean.”
\verse And Haggai answered and said, “ ‘So \textit{it is with} this people, and \textit{with} this nation before me,’ \textit{declares} Adonai, ‘and so \textit{it is with} every kind of work of their hands; and what they offer there \textit{is} unclean.
\verse But now, please \textit{consider} from this day forward, before one stone was placed on another in the temple of Adonai,
\verse \textit{from that time when} one came to a heap of twenty \textit{measures}, there were \textit{only} ten, and \textit{when} one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty measures, there were \textit{only} twenty.
\verse I struck you with blight, and with plant mildew, and hail, all the work of your hands. But \textit{you did not come back to me},’ \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse ‘\textit{Please consider} from this day forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth \textit{month}, from the day that the foundation of Adonai’s temple was laid, \textit{consider}:
\verse \textit{Is there} still seed in the store chamber? Do the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree still produce nothing? From this day \textit{forward} I will bless \textit{you}.’ ”
\verseWithHeading{The Coming Kingdom} And the word of Adonai came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth \textit{day} of the month saying,
\verse “Say to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah: I \textit{am} going to shake the heavens and the earth,
\verse and I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the military strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow chariots and their drivers; horses and their riders will fall, every one by the sword of another!
\verse ‘On that day,’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts, ‘I will take you, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant,’ \textit{declares} Adonai, ‘and I will make you a signet ring, for I have chosen you,’ \textit{declares} Adonai of hosts.”
