\begin{biblechapter} % Isaiah 1
\verseWithHeading{Superscription} The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, \textit{and} Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
\verseWithHeading{Rebellious Judah} Hear, heavens, 
and listen, earth, 
for Adonai has spoken: 
“I reared children 
and I brought \textit{them} up, 
but they rebelled against me.
\verse An ox knows its owner 
and a donkey the manger of its master. 
Israel does not know; 
my people do not understand.
\verse Ah, sinful nation, 
a people heavy \textit{with} iniquity, 
offspring of evildoers, 
children who deal corruptly. 
They have forsaken Adonai; 
they have despised the holy one of Israel. 
They are estranged \textit{and gone} backward.
\verse Why do you want to be beaten again? 
You continue \textit{in} rebellion. 
\textit{The} whole of \textit{the} head \textit{is} sick, 
and \textit{the} whole of \textit{the} heart \textit{is} faint.
\verse From the sole of the foot and up to \textit{the} head 
there is no health in it; 
bruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed, 
and they have not been bound up 
and not softened with the oil.
\verse Your country \textit{is} desolate, 
your cities \textit{are} burned \textit{with} fire; 
\textit{As for} your land, aliens are devouring it in your presence, 
and \textit{it is} desolate, like devastation \textit{by} foreigners.
\verse And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, 
like a shelter in a cucumber field, 
like a city that is besieged.
\verse If Adonai of hosts had not left us survivors, 
we would have been as few as Sodom, 
we would have become like Gomorrah.
\verse Hear the word of Adonai, rulers of Sodom! 
Listen \textit{to} the teaching of our God, people of Gomorrah!
\verse What \textit{is the} abundance of your sacrifices to me? says Adonai. 
I have had enough \textit{of} burnt offerings of rams 
and \textit{the} fat \textit{of} fattened animals 
and I do not delight in \textit{the} blood of bulls 
and ram-lambs and goats.
\verse When you come to appear before me, 
who asked for this from your hand: 
you trampling my courts?
\verse You must not \textit{continue} to bring offerings of futility, 
incense—it \textit{is} an abomination to me; 
new moon and Sabbath, \textit{the} calling of a convocation— 
I cannot endure iniquity with \textit{solemn} assembly.
\verse Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates; 
they have become to me like \textit{a} burden, 
I am not able to bear \textit{them}.
\verse And when you stretch out your hands, 
I will hide my eyes from you; 
even though you make many prayers, 
I \textit{will} not be listening. 
Your hands are full of blood.
\verse Wash! Make yourselves clean! 
Remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes! 
Cease to do evil!
\verse Learn to do good! 
Seek justice! Rescue \textit{the} oppressed! 
Defend \textit{the} orphan! Plead for \textit{the} widow!
\verse “Come now, and let us argue,” says Adonai. 
“Even though your sins are like scarlet, they will be white like snow; 
even though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.
\verse If you are willing and you are obedient, 
you shall eat the good of the land.
\verse But if you refuse and you rebel, you shall be devoured \textit{by the} sword. For the mouth of Adonai has spoken.”
\verseWithHeading{Purifying Jerusalem} How has a faithful city become like a whore? 
Full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.
\verse Your silver has become \textit{as} dross; 
Your wine \textit{is} diluted with waters.
\verse Your princes \textit{are} rebels 
and companions of thieves. 
Every one loves a bribe 
and runs after gifts. 
They do not defend \textit{the} orphan 
and \textit{the} legal dispute of \textit{the} widow does not come before them.
\verse Therefore, the declaration of the Lord Adonai of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: 
“Ah, I will be relieved of my enemies, 
and I will avenge myself on my foes.
\verse And I will turn my hand against you; 
I will purify your dross like lye, 
and I will remove all \textit{of} your tin.
\verse And I will restore your judges, as at the first, 
and your counselors, as at the beginning. 
After this \textit{you will be called} the city of righteousness, 
faithful city.
\verse Zion will be redeemed by justice, 
and those of her who repent, by righteousness.
\verse But \textit{the} destruction \textit{of} rebels and sinners \textit{shall be} together, 
and those who forsake Adonai will perish.
\verse For you will be ashamed of \textit{the} oaks \textit{in} which you delighted, 
and you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.
\verse For you shall be like an oak withering its leaves, 
and like a garden where there is no water for her.
\verse And the strong \textit{man} shall become like tinder, 
and his work like a spark. 
And both of them shall burn together, 
and there is not one to quench \textit{them}.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Isaiah 2
\verseWithHeading{The Mountain of Adonai} The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
\verse And it shall happen in the future of the days 
the mountain of the house of Adonai \textit{shall} be established; 
it will be among the highest of the mountains, 
and it shall be raised from \textit{the} hills. 
All \textit{of} the nations shall travel to him;
\verse many peoples shall come. 
And they shall say, 
“Come, let us go up to the mountain of Adonai, 
to the house of the God of Jacob, 
and may he teach us part of his ways, 
and let us walk in his paths.” 
For instruction shall go out from Zion, 
and the word of Adonai from Jerusalem.
\verse He shall judge between the nations 
and he shall arbitrate for many peoples. 
They shall beat their swords into ploughshares 
and their spears into pruning hooks. 
A nation shall not lift up a sword against a nation, 
and they shall not learn war again.
\verseWithHeading{The Day of Adonai} House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Adonai.
\verse For you have forsaken your people, house of Jacob, 
because they are full from \textit{the} east, 
and \textit{of} soothsayers like the Philistines, 
and \textit{they make alliances} with the offspring of foreigners.
\verse And its land is filled \textit{with} silver and gold, 
and there is no end to its treasures; 
and its land is filled \textit{with} horses, 
and \textit{there is} no end to its chariots.
\verse Its land is filled \textit{with} idols; 
they bow down to the work of their hands, 
to what they made \textit{with} their fingers.
\verse So humanity is humbled; 
everyone is humbled, 
and you must not forgive them.
\verse Enter into the rock 
and hide yourself in the dust 
from the presence of the terror of Adonai 
and from the glory of his majesty.
\verse The \textit{haughty eyes} of humanity will be brought low, 
and the pride of everyone will be humbled, 
and Adonai alone will be exalted on that day.
\verse For \textit{there is} a day for Adonai of hosts 
against all of \textit{the} proud and \textit{the} lofty 
and against all that is lifted up and humble,
\verse and against all the lofty and lifted up cedars of Lebanon, 
and against all the large trees of Bashan,
\verse and against all the high mountains, 
and against all the lofty hills,
\verse and against every kind of high tower, 
and against every kind of fortified wall,
\verse and against all the ships of Tarshish, 
and against all the ships of desire.
\verse And the haughtiness of the people shall be humbled, 
and the pride of everyone shall be brought low, 
and Adonai alone will be exalted on that day.
\verse And the idols shall pass away entirely,
\verse and they will enter into \textit{the} caves of \textit{the} rocks 
and into \textit{the} holes of \textit{the} ground 
from the presence of the terror of Adonai 
and from the glory of his majesty 
\textit{when he rises} to terrify the earth.
\verse On that day humanity will throw away its idols of silver 
and its idols of gold, 
which they made for it to worship, 
to the rodents and to the bats—
\verse to enter into the crevices of the rocks 
and into the clefts of the crags 
from the presence of the terror of Adonai 
and from the glory of his majesty, 
\textit{when he rises} to terrify the earth.
\verse Turn away from humanity, 
who \textit{has} breath in its nostrils, 
for by what \textit{is} it esteemed?
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Isaiah 3
\verseWithHeading{Leaders of Judah and Jerusalem} For look, the Lord Adonai of hosts \textit{is} removing \textit{every source of support} 
from Jerusalem and from Judah: 
all of \textit{the} supplies of bread 
and all of \textit{the} supplies of water,
\verse mighty warrior and man of war, 
judge and prophet, 
and diviner and elder,
\verse captain of fifty and the honorable men of rank, 
and counselor and skillful magicians and skillful enchanter.
\verse And I will make boys their princes, 
and children shall rule over them.
\verse And the people will be oppressed \textit{by each other} 
and a man by his neighbor. 
The boy will act arrogantly toward the elder, 
and the dishonorable toward the honorable.
\verse Indeed, a man will seize his brother 
\textit{in} the house of his father: 
“\textit{You have a cloak}; 
you shall be a leader for us, 
and this heap of ruins \textit{shall be} under your hand!”
\verse He will lift up \textit{his voice} on that day, saying, 
“I will not be a healer; 
in my house there is no bread 
and there is no cloak. 
You shall not make me \textit{the} leader of \textit{the} people!”
\verse For Jerusalem has stumbled, 
and Judah has fallen 
because their speech and their deeds \textit{are} against Adonai, 
defying the eyes of his glory.
\verse The look on their faces testifies against them 
and they declare their sin like Sodom; 
they do not hide \textit{it}. 
Woe to their soul! 
For they have dealt out evil to themselves.
\verse Tell \textit{the} innocent that \textit{it is} good 
for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.
\verse Woe to the wicked! \textit{It is} bad! 
For what is done \textit{by} his hands will be done to him.
\verse My people—children are their oppressors, 
and women rule over them. 
My people, your leaders are misleading \textit{you}, 
and they confuse the course of your paths.
\verse Adonai takes his stand to conduct a legal case 
and takes his stand to judge \textit{the} peoples.
\verse Adonai enters into judgment with the elders of his people and its princes. 
“And you! You have devoured the vineyard; 
the spoil of the poor \textit{is} in your houses!
\verse \textit{Why} do you crush my people 
and grind \textit{the} face of \textit{the} poor?” \textit{declares} the Lord Adonai of hosts.
\verseWithHeading{The Pride of Jerusalem’s Women} And Adonai said: “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, 
and they walk \textit{with} outstretched neck, 
and they give flirting glances \textit{with their} eyes, 
\textit{mincing along as they go}, 
and \textit{with their feet they rattle their bangles},
\verse the Lord will make the heads of the daughters of Zion scabby, 
and Adonai will lay their foreheads bare.”
\verse In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets 
and the headbands and the crescent necklaces,
\verse the pendants and the bracelets and the veils,
\verse the headdresses and the armlets and the sashes, 
and the \textit{perfume boxes} and the amulets,
\verse the signet rings and the nose rings,
\verse the festal robes and the mantles, 
and the cloaks and the handbags,
\verse and the mirrors and the linen garments, 
and the turbans and the wraps.
\verse And this shall happen: There will be 
a stench instead of perfume, 
and a rope instead of a sash, 
and baldness instead of a well-set hairdo, 
and a clothing wrap of sackcloth instead of a rich robe, 
branding instead of beauty.
\verse Your men shall fall by the sword, 
and your warriors in battle.
\verse And her gates shall lament and mourn, 
and she shall be banished; 
she shall sit upon the ground.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Isaiah 4
\verse And seven women shall grasp at one man on that day, saying, 
“We will eat our own bread, 
and we will wear our own clothing; 
only \textit{let us be called by your name}! 
Take away our disgrace!”
\verseWithHeading{The Glory of the Branch of Adonai} On that day the branch of Adonai shall become beautiful and glorious, 
and the fruit of the land \textit{shall become the} pride and glory of the survivors of Israel.
\verse And this shall happen: He who is left in Zion 
and he who remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, 
everyone written for life in Jerusalem,
\verse when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion 
and cleansed the blood of Jerusalem from her midst 
by a spirit of judgment 
and by a spirit of burning.
\verse Then Adonai will create over all of the site of \textit{Mount Zion} 
and over her assembly a cloud by day 
and smoke and the brightness of flaming fire \textit{by} night. 
Indeed, over all \textit{the} glory \textit{there will be} a canopy,
\verse and it will be a shelter for shade from \textit{the} heat by day, 
and a refuge and a hiding place from rainstorm and from rain.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Isaiah 5
\verseWithHeading{The Song of the Vineyard} Let me sing for my beloved 
a song of my love concerning his vineyard: 
\textit{My beloved had a vineyard} on \textit{a fertile hill}.
\verse And he dug it and cleared it of stones, 
and he planted it \textit{with} choice vines, 
and he built a watchtower in the middle of it, 
and he even hewed out a wine vat in it, 
and he waited for \textit{it} to yield grapes— 
but it yielded wild grapes.
\verse And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem 
and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.
\verse What more \textit{was there} to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it? 
Why did I hope for \textit{it} to yield grapes, and it yielded wild grapes?
\verse And now let me tell you what I myself am about to do to my vineyard.
\verse \textit{I will} remove its hedge, and it shall become a devastation. 
\textit{I will} break down its wall, and it shall become a trampling.
\verse And I will make it a wasteland; 
it shall not be pruned and hoed, 
and it shall be overgrown \textit{with} briers and thornbushes. 
And concerning the clouds, I will command \textit{them not to send} rain down upon it.
\verseWithHeading{Woes on the Wicked} Ah! Those who \textit{join} house with house, 
they join field together with field 
until \textit{there is no place} 
and you are caused to dwell alone in the midst of the land.
\verse Adonai of hosts \textit{said} in my ears:
\verse \textit{Surely} many houses shall become a desolation, 
large and beautiful \textit{ones} without inhabitant.
\verse For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, 
and \textit{the} seed of a homer will yield an ephah.
\verse Ah! Those who rise early in the morning, 
they pursue strong drink. 
Those who linger in the evening, 
wine inflames them.
\verse And \textit{there} will be lyre and harp, 
tambourine and flute, 
and wine \textit{at} their feasts, 
but they do not look at the deeds of Adonai, 
and they do not see the work of his hands.
\verse Therefore my people will go into exile without knowledge, 
\textit{and} their nobles \textit{will be} men of hunger, 
and their multitude \textit{is} parched \textit{with} thirst.
\verse Therefore Sheol has enlarged its throat, 
and it has opened wide its mouth without limit, 
and her nobles will go down, and her multitude, 
her tumult and those who revel in her.
\verse And humankind is bowed down, 
and man is brought low, 
and \textit{the} eyes of \textit{the} haughty are humiliated.
\verse But Adonai of hosts is exalted by justice, 
and the holy God shows himself holy by righteousness.
\verse And then \textit{the} lambs will graze as \textit{in} their pasture, 
and \textit{fatlings, kids will eat among the sites of ruins.}
\verse Ah! Those who drag iniquity along with the cords of falsehood 
and sin as with rope of the cart,
\verse those who say, 
“Let him make haste; 
let him hurry his work 
so that we may see it 
and let it draw near 
and let the plan of the holy one of Israel come 
so that we may know \textit{it}!”
\verse Ah! Those who call evil good and good evil, 
those who put darkness for light and light for darkness, 
those who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
\verse Ah! \textit{Those who are} wise in their own eyes 
and have understanding \textit{in their view}!
\verse Ah! Heroes at drinking wine, 
and men of capability at mixing strong drink!
\verse Those who acquit the guilty because of a bribe 
and remove \textit{the} justice of \textit{the} innocent from him.
\verse Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, 
and dry grass sinks down \textit{in the} flame, 
so their root will become like \textit{the} stench, 
and their blossom will go up like \textit{the} dust. 
For they have rejected the instruction of Adonai of hosts, 
and they have treated the word of the holy one of Israel with contempt.
\verseWithHeading{Adonai’s Outstretched Hand} In all of this his anger has not turned back, 
and still his hand is stretched out.
\verse And he will raise a signal for a nation from afar, 
and he will whistle for it from the end of the earth. 
And look! It comes quickly, swiftly!
\verse None \textit{is} weary, 
and none among him stumbles; 
none slumbers and none sleeps. 
And no loincloth on his waist is opened, 
and no thong of his sandals is drawn away.
\verse Whose arrows are sharp, 
and all of his bows are bent. 
The hoofs of his horses are reckoned like flint, 
and his wheels like the storm wind.
\verse His roaring \textit{is} like the lion, 
and he roars like young lions. 
And he growls and seizes his prey, 
and he carries \textit{it} off, 
and not one can rescue \textit{it}.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Isaiah 6
\verseWithHeading{Isaiah’s Commission} In the year of the death of Uzziah the king, I saw the Lord sitting on a high and raised throne, and the hem of his robe \textit{was} filling the temple.
\verse Seraphs \textit{were} standing above him. \textit{Each had six wings}: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
\verse And the one called to the other and said, “Holy, holy, holy \textit{is} Adonai of hosts! 
The \textit{whole earth is full of his glory}.”
\verse And the pivots of the thresholds shook from the sound of those who called, and the house was filled \textit{with} smoke.
\verse And I said, “Woe to me! For I am destroyed! For I \textit{am} a man \textit{of unclean lips}, and I \textit{am} living among a people \textit{of unclean lips}, for my eyes have seen the king, Adonai of hosts!”
\verse Then one of the seraphs flew to me, and in his hand \textit{was} a hot coal he had taken from the altar with tongs.
\verse And he touched my mouth, and he said, “Look! This has touched your lips 
and has removed your guilt, 
and your sin is annulled.”
\verse Then I heard \textit{the} voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? 
And who will go for us?” And I said, “I \textit{am} here! 
Send me!”
\verse And he said, “Go and say to this people,
\verse ‘Keep on listening and do not comprehend! 
And keep on looking and do not understand!’
\verse Then I said, “Until when, Lord?” And he said,
\verse “Until \textit{the} cities lie wasted without inhabitant, 
and houses without people, 
and the land is ruined \textit{and} a waste,
\verse and Adonai sends the people far away, 
and the abandonment is great in the midst of the land.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Isaiah 7
\verseWithHeading{The Sign to Ahaz} This happened in the days of Ahaz, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah. Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up \textit{to} Jerusalem for warfare against it, but he was not able to fight against it.
\verse When it was reported to the house of David, saying “Aram stands by Ephraim,” his heart and the heart of his people shook like the shaking of the trees of \textit{the} forest because of \textit{the} wind.
\verse Then Adonai said to Isaiah, “Go out to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-Jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on \textit{the} highway of \textit{the} washer’s field.
\verse And you must say to him, ‘Take heed and be quiet! You must not fear, and your heart must not be faint because of these two stumps of smoldering firebrands, \textit{because of the fierce anger of} Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah.
\verse Because Aram has plotted evil against you \textit{with} Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, saying,
\verse “Let us go up against Judah and let us tear her apart, \textit{and let us lay it open and so bring it unto ourselves}, and let us install the son of Tabeel \textit{as} king in her midst.”
\verse Thus says the Lord Adonai, “It shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass.
\verse For the head of Aram \textit{is} Damascus, and the head of Damascus \textit{is} Rezin, and in sixty-five years from now Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.
\verse And the head of Ephraim \textit{is} Samaria, and the head of Samaria \textit{is} the son of Remaliah. If you do not believe then you will not endure.” ’ ”
\verse And Adonai continued to speak to Ahaz, saying,
\verse “Ask for a sign for yourself from Adonai; make \textit{it} deep \textit{as} Sheol or make \textit{it} high as above.”
\verse But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put Adonai to the test.”
\verse Then he said, “Hear, house of David! \textit{Is it} too little for you to make men weary, that you should also make my God weary?
\verse Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look! the virgin \textit{is} with child and she is about to give birth \textit{to} a son, and she shall call his name ‘God with us.’
\verse He shall eat curds and honey until he knows to reject the evil and to choose the good.
\verse For before the boy knows to reject the evil and to choose the good, \textit{the land whose two kings you dread will be abandoned.}
\verseWithHeading{That Day} “Adonai will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your ancestor days that have not come since \textit{the} day Ephraim departed from Judah: the king of Assyria.”
\verse And this shall happen: On that day, Adonai will whistle for the fly that \textit{is} at the end of the stream of Egypt and the bee that \textit{is} in the land of Assyria.
\verse And all of them will come and settle in the rivers of the cliffs and in the clefts of the rocks and on all of the thornbushes and watering places.
\verse On that day, the Lord will shave the head and the hair of the feet with a razor of the one hired from beyond \textit{the} river—with the king of Assyria—and it will even take off the beard.
\verse And this shall happen: on that day, a young man will keep a young cow of \textit{the} herd and two sheep alive.
\verse And this shall happen: because of the abundance of milk production, he will eat curds, for every one that is left in the midst of the land will eat curds and honey.
\verse And this shall happen on that day: Every place where there are a thousand vines for a thousand silver \textit{pieces} will become briers, and it will be thornbushes.
\verse One will go there with arrows and bow, for all of the land will be briers and thornbushes.
\verse And \textit{as for} all of the hills that they hoed with the hoe, you will not go there, \textit{for} fear of briers and thornbushes. And it will become like pastureland \textit{for} cattle and overtrodden land \textit{for} sheep.
\end{biblechapter}

\begin{biblechapter} % Isaiah 8
\verseWithHeading{Signs of the Assyrian Invasion} Then Adonai said to me, “Take yourself a large tablet and write on it with a common stylus pen: Maher-Halal-Hash-Baz.
\verse And I will require reliable witnesses as a witness for me: Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.”
\verse And I approached the prophetess, and she conceived, and she gave birth to a son. And Adonai said to me, “Call his name Maher-Halal-Hash-Baz.
\verse For before the boy knows to call ‘my father’ and ‘my mother,’ \textit{one} will carry away the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria in the presence of the king of Assyria.”
\verseWithHeading{Shiloah Waters and Euphrates Flood} And Adonai continued to speak to me again, saying,
\verse “Because this people has refused the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices \textit{over} Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
\verse therefore look! The Lord \textit{is} bringing up the waters of the great and mighty river against them, the king of Assyria and all his glory.
\verse And he will rise above all his channels, 
and he will flow over all his banks.
\verse And he will sweep into Judah; 
he will overflow and he will flood up to \textit{the} neck. 
He will reach, and \textit{he will spread his wings out over your entire land}, God with us.”
\verse Be broken, \textit{you} peoples, and be dismayed. 
And listen, all distant \textit{parts of the} earth; 
gird yourselves and be dismayed; 
gird yourselves and be dismayed!
\verseWithHeading{Wait for Adonai} For Adonai said this to me \textit{while his hand weighed heavily on me}, 
and he \textit{warned me not to walk} in the way of this people, saying,
\verse “You must not call conspiracy everything that this people calls conspiracy, 
and you must not \textit{share its fear}, and you must not be in dread.
\verse You shall regard Adonai of hosts as holy, 
and he \textit{is} your fear, and he \textit{is} your dread.
\verse And he will become like a sanctuary and a stumbling-stone, 
and like a stumbling-rock for the two houses of Israel, 
like a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\verse And many shall stumble among them, 
and they shall fall and they shall be broken, 
and they shall be ensnared and they shall be caught.”
\verse Bind up \textit{the} testimony; 
seal \textit{the} teaching among my disciples.
\verse And I will wait for Adonai, 
who hides his face from the house of Jacob, 
and I will await him.
\verse Look! I and the children whom Adonai has given to me \textit{are} like signs and portents in Israel from Adonai of hosts, the one who dwells on the mountain of Zion.
\verse Now if they tell you, “Consult the ghosts and the spirits, those who chirp and those who mutter. Should not a people consult its gods, the dead on behalf of the living,
\verse for teaching and for testimony?” \textit{surely they \textit{who} speak like this have no dawn}.
\verse And it will pass through it distressed and hungry, and this shall happen: when it is hungry, it will be enraged, and it will curse its king and its gods, and it will face upwar
\verse or look to \textit{the} earth. But look! Distress and darkness, \textit{the} gloom of affliction! And \textit{it will be} thrust \textit{into} darkness!

\begin{biblechapter} % Isaiah 9
\verseWithHeading{New Light: The Birth of a King}  \textit{But there will be no gloom for those who were in distress}. In former times he treated \textit{the} land of Zebulun and Naphtali with contempt, but in the future he will honor the way of the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee \textit{of} the nations.
\verse The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; 
light has shined on those who lived in a land of darkness.
\verse You have made the nation numerous; 
you have not made the joy great. 
They rejoice in your presence as \textit{with} joy at the harvest, 
as they rejoice when they divide plunder.
\verse For you have shattered the yoke of its burden 
and the stick of its shoulder, 
the rod of its oppressor, on the day of Midian.
\verse For every boot \textit{that marches and shakes the earth} 
and garment rolled in blood 
\textit{will} be for burning—fire fuel.
\verse For a child has been born for us; 
a son has been given to us. 
And the dominion will be on his shoulder, 
and his name is called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, 
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
\verse \textit{His dominion will grow continually, 
and to peace there will be no end} 
on the throne of David and over his kingdom, 
to establish it and sustain it 
with justice and righteousness 
now and forever. 
The zeal of Adonai of hosts will do this.
\verseWithHeading{Adonai’s Anger against Arrogance} The Lord has sent out a word against Jacob, 
and it fell on Israel.
\verse And all of the people knew it, 
Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria 
in pride and arrogance of heart, saying,
\verse “\textit{The} bricks have fallen, but we will build \textit{with} dressed stone. 
\textit{The} sycamore-fig trees were felled, but we will replace \textit{them with} cedars.”
\verse So Adonai strengthened \textit{the adversaries of Rezin} against him, 
and he provoked his enemies—
\verse Aram from \textit{the} east 
and Philistines from \textit{the} west— 
and they devoured Israel with the whole mouth. 
He has not turned away his anger in all of this, 
and his hand is still stretched out.
\verse And the people did not turn to the one who struck it, 
and they did not seek Adonai of hosts.
\verse So Adonai cut off head and tail from Israel, 
palm branch and reed \textit{in} one day.
\verse Elders and \textit{the respectable} \textit{are} the head, 
and prophets who teach lies \textit{are} the tail.
\verse And the leaders of this people were misleading \textit{them}, 
and those who were led \textit{were} confused.
\verse Therefore the Lord did not rejoice over its young men, 
and he did not have compassion on its orphans and widows, 
for everyone \textit{was} godless and an evildoer, 
and every mouth \textit{was} speaking folly. 
In all of this his anger did not turn away, 
and still his hand \textit{is} stretched out.
\verse For wickedness burned like fire; 
it consumed brier and thorn. 
And it kindled the thickets of the forest, 
and they swirled upward \textit{in} a column of smoke.
\verse The land was burned through the wrath of Adonai of hosts, 
and the people became like fire fuel. 
\textit{People had no compassion toward each other}.
\verse They devoured on \textit{the} right but \textit{still} were hungry 
and devoured on \textit{the} left but they were not satisfied. 
Each one devoured the flesh of his arm,
\verse Manasseh \textit{devoured} Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh; 
together they \textit{were} against Judah. 
In all of this his anger has not turned away, 
and still his hand \textit{is} stretched out.

and they plunder orphans.

and at calamity? It comes from afar! 
To whom will you flee for help, 
and where will you leave your wealth,

In all of this his anger has not turned away,

\verseWithHeading{Judgment on Assyria’s Arrogance} Ah! Assyria, the rod of my anger, 
and a staff is in their hand: my wrath!
\verse I send him against a godless nation, 
and I command him against the people of my wrath, 
to capture spoil 
and to carry off plunder, 
and to make them a trampling place, 
like \textit{the} clay of \textit{the} streets.
\verse But he does not think this, 
and his heart does not plan this. 
For \textit{it is} in his heart to destroy 
and to cut off not a few nations.
\verse For he says, “\textit{Are} not my commanders altogether kings?
\verse \textit{Is} not Calno like Carchemish? 
\textit{Is} not Hamath like Arpad? 
\textit{Is} not Samaria like Damascus?
\verse As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols 
—and their images were \textit{greater than those of} Jerusalem and Samaria—
\verse shall I not do to Jerusalem and its idols 
what I have done to Samaria and her idols?”
\verse And this shall happen: when the Lord has finished all his work against \textit{Mount Zion} and Jerusalem, “I will punish the \textit{arrogance} of the king of Assyria and \textit{his haughtiness}.”
\verse For he says,
\verse “I have done \textit{it} by the strength of my hand 
and by my wisdom, for I have understanding, 
and I have removed \textit{the} boundaries of peoples, 
and I have plundered their stores, 
and like a bull I have brought down \textit{the inhabitants}.
\verse And my hand has found, like \textit{a} nest, the wealth of the peoples, 
and like the gathering of forsaken eggs, I myself have gathered all the earth. 
And \textit{there} was no fluttering wing or open mouth or chirp.”
\verse Does the ax boast against the one who cuts with it, 
or the saw magnify itself against \textit{the} one who moves it to and fro? 
\textit{As if a rod should move the one who lifts it}! 
\textit{As if a staff should lift up that which is not wood}!
\verse Therefore the Lord, Adonai of hosts, will send leanness among his sturdy warriors, 
and a burning like \textit{the} burning of fire will burn under his glory.
\verse And the light of Israel will become like a fire, 
and his holy one like a flame, 
and it will burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day.
\verse And he will destroy the glory of his forest and orchard \textit{completely}, 
and it will be like the wasting away of one who is sick.
\verseWithHeading{The Return of the Remnant} And this shall happen: on that day, the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will not continue to lean on \textit{the} one who struck it 
but will lean on Adonai, the holy one of Israel, in truth.
\verse A remnant will return— 
the remnant of Jacob—to \textit{the} mighty God.
\verse For though your people Israel was like the sand of the sea, 
\textit{only} a remnant of it will return. 
Annihilation \textit{is} determined, 
overflowing \textit{with} righteousness.
\verse For the Lord Adonai of hosts \textit{is} about to make a complete destruction 
and a determined end in the midst of all the earth.
\verse Therefore thus says the Lord Adonai of hosts:
\verse “My people who live \textit{in} Zion, 
you must not be afraid of Assyria. 
It beats you with the rod, 
and it lifts up its staff against you \textit{as the Egyptians did}.
\verse \textit{My} indignation will come to an end \textit{in just a very little while}, 
and my anger \textit{will be} directed to their destruction.”
\verse And this shall happen: on that day,
\verse he will remove his burden from your shoulder 
and his yoke from your neck, 
\textit{and a yoke will be destroyed because of fat}.
\verse He has come to Aiath, 
he has passed through Migron; 
at Micmash he deposited his baggage.
\verse They crossed over \textit{the} pass; 
Geba \textit{is} a place of overnight lodging for us. 
Ramah trembles; 
Gibeah of Saul has fled.
\verse Daughter of Gallim, cry out \textit{with} your voice; 
Laishah, listen! 
\textit{Anathoth is poor}.
\verse Madmenah flees! 
The inhabitants of Gebim bring themselves into safety!
\verse \textit{This day} \textit{taking a stand} at Nob, 
he will shake his fist \textit{at} the mountain of the daughter of Zion, 
\textit{at} the hill of Jerusalem.

\verseWithHeading{The Cornerstone of Zion} Therefore hear the word of Adonai, men of mockery, 
rulers of these people in Jerusalem:
\verse Because you have said, “We have \textit{made} a covenant with death, 
and we have made an agreement with Sheol. \textit{The} overwhelming flood, when it passes through, will not come to us, for we have made lies our refuge, 
and we have hidden ourselves in falsehood.”
\verse Therefore the Lord Adonai says this: “Look! I \textit{am} laying a stone in Zion, 
a \textit{tested} stone, 
a precious cornerstone, 
a founded foundation: ‘The one who trusts will not \textit{panic}.’
\verse And I will make justice \textit{the} measuring line, 
and righteousness \textit{the} plumb line; 
and hail will sweep away \textit{the} refuge of lies, 
and waters will flood over \textit{the} hiding place.
\verse And your covenant with death will be annulled, 
and your agreement with Sheol will not stand; 
you will become a trampling place for the overwhelming flood when it passes through.
\verse \textit{As often as it passes through}, it will take you, 
for \textit{morning by morning} it will pass through, 
in the day and in the night, and understanding \textit{the} message will be only terror.”
\verse For the bed is too short \textit{to stretch out on}, 
and the covering is \textit{too} narrow when wrapping oneself.
\verse For Adonai will rise up as \textit{at} Mount Perazim; 
he will rave as \textit{in the} valley at Gibeon 
to do his deed—his deed \textit{is} strange— 
and to work his work—his work \textit{is} alien!
\verse And now you must not scoff, 
or your bonds will be strong, for I have heard from the Lord, Adonai of hosts: complete destruction 
decreed upon all the land.

and barley \textit{in} an appointed place, 
and spelt grain \textit{as} its border?
\verse And his God instructs him about the prescription; 
he teaches him.
\verse For dill is not threshed with \textit{a} threshing sledge, 
nor is a wheel of a utility cart \textit{rolled} over cumin, 
but dill is beaten out with \textit{a} stick, 
and cumin with \textit{a} rod.
\verse Grain is crushed fine, 
but certainly one does not thresh it forever; 
and one drives the wheel of his cart, 
but his horses do not crush it.

\verse Look, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt, which \textit{if} a man leans on it, goes into his hand and bores through it! Such \textit{is} Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all those who trust in him.
\verse And if you say to me, ‘We trust in Adonai our God,’ \textit{was it} not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed? And he said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall bow down in the \textit{presence} of this altar.’ ”
\verse And now please make a wager with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, \textit{that is,} if you are able \textit{put} riders for yourself on them!
\verse But how can you drive back \textit{one governor among the least of my master’s servants}, when you trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
\verse And now was it without Adonai that I have come up against this land to destroy it? Adonai said to me, “Go up against this land and destroy it!” ’ ”
\verse And Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we can understand \textit{it}, and you must not speak to us in Judean in the \textit{hearing} of the people who \textit{are} on the wall.”
\verse But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to your masters and you? \textit{Was it} not for the people who sit on the wall, to eat their dung and drink their urine with you?”
\verse Then Rabshakeh stood and called in a great voice in Judean and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
\verse Thus says the king: ‘\textit{Do} not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you!
\verse And \textit{do} not let Hezekiah make you rely on Adonai, saying, “Surely Adonai will deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria!”
\verse You must not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: “Make a blessing with me, and come out to me, and each one will eat \textit{from} his vine and \textit{from} his fig tree and drink water from his cistern,
\verse until \textit{I come} and take you to a land like your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards,

I myself have gone up \textit{the} height of \textit{the} mountains, 
\textit{to} the remote areas of Lebanon. 
And I cut off \textit{its tall cedars}, 
the choicest of its junipers. 
And I came \textit{to} the height of its limit,

they have become \textit{like} plants of \textit{the} field,

\verse And the remnant of the house of Judah that remain shall \textit{grow} roots downwards and make fruit upwards.

My eyes are weak toward the height. 
Lord, I have oppression; lend me support!

I will walk slowly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.
\verse Lord, they live by them, and the life of my spirit belongs to all among them. 
And restore me to health and keep me alive!
\verse Look! Bitterness was bitter to me for peace. 
And you were the one who loved my life from \textit{the} pit of destruction,

\verse For Sheol cannot praise you; death \textit{cannot} praise you. 
Those who go down \textit{to the} pit cannot hope for your faithfulness.

\verse However, he was the one who lifted up our sicknesses,

yet he did not open his mouth; 
he was brought like \textit{a} lamb to \textit{the} slaughter, 
and like a sheep is dumb before its shearers, 
so he did not open his mouth.

lift up your voice like \textit{a} trumpet, 
and declare to my people their rebellion, 
and to the house of Jacob their sins.
\verse Yet they seek me day \textit{by} day, 
and they desire the knowledge of my ways 
like a nation that \textit{practiced} righteousness, 
and had not forsaken the judgment of its God; 
they ask me for \textit{righteous judgments}, 
they desire the closeness of God.
\verse ‘Why do we fast, and you do not see \textit{it}? 
We humiliate our soul, and you do not notice \textit{it}?’ 
Look! You find delight on the day of your fast, 
and you oppress all your workers!
\verse Look! You fast to quarrel and strife, 
and to strike with a \textit{wicked fist}. 
You shall not fast as \textit{you do} \textit{today}, 
to \textit{make your voice heard} on the height.
\verse Is \textit{the} fast I choose like this, 
a day for humankind to humiliate \textit{himself}? 
To bow his head like a reed, 
and \textit{make} his bed \textit{on} sackcloth and ashes; 
you call this a fast 
and a day of pleasure to Adonai?
\verse Is this not \textit{the} fast I choose: to release \textit{the} bonds of injustice, 
to untie \textit{the} ropes of \textit{the} yoke, 
and to let \textit{the} oppressed go free, 
and \textit{tear} every yoke to pieces?
\verse \textit{Is it} not to break your bread for the hungry? 
You must bring \textit{home} \textit{the} poor, \textit{the} homeless. 
When you see \textit{the} naked, you must cover him, 
and you must not hide yourself from your \textit{relatives}.
\verse Then your light shall break forth like the dawn, 
and your healing shall grow quickly. 
And your salvation shall go before you; 
the glory of Adonai will be your rear guard.
\verse Then you shall call, and Adonai himself will answer. 
You shall cry for help, and he will say, ‘Here I \textit{am}!’ 
If you remove from among you \textit{the} yoke, 
the \textit{finger-pointing} and \textit{evil speech},
\verse if you offer your soul to the hungry, 
and you satisfy \textit{the} appetite of \textit{the} afflicted, 
then your light shall rise in the darkness, 
and your darkness \textit{will be} like noon.
\verse And Adonai will lead you continually, and satisfy your soul in a barren land, 
and he will strengthen your bones, 
and you shall be like a well-watered garden, 
and like a spring of water whose water does not fail.
\verse And they shall rebuild ancient ruins from you; 
you shall erect \textit{the} foundations of \textit{many generations,} 
and \textit{you shall be called} \textit{the} bricklayer \textit{of} \textit{the} breach, 
\textit{the} restorer of paths to live \textit{in}.
\verse If you hold your foot back from \textit{the} Sabbath, 
\textit{from} doing your affairs on \textit{my holy day}, 
if you call the Sabbath a pleasure, 
the holy \textit{day} of Adonai honorable, 
if you honor him \textit{more than} doing your ways,

\verseWithHeading{Rampant Transgression} Look! The hand of Adonai is not too short \textit{to save}, 
and his ear is not \textit{too} dull \textit{to hear}.
\verse Rather, your iniquities have been \textit{barriers} between you and your God, 
and your sins have hidden \textit{his} face from you, from hearing.
\verse For your hands are defiled with blood, 
and your fingers with iniquity. 
Your lips have spoken lies, 
your tongue speaks wickedness.
\verse There is nobody \textit{who pleads with} justice, 
and there is nobody who judges with honesty. 
They rely on nothing 
and speak vanity. 
They conceive trouble 
and beget iniquity;
\verse they hatch viper eggs, 
and they weave a spider web. 
One who eats their eggs dies, 
and that which is pressed is hatched \textit{as} a serpent.
\verse Their webs cannot become clothing, 
and they cannot cover themselves with their works. 
Their works \textit{are} works of iniquity, 
and deeds of violence \textit{are} in their hands.
\verse Their feet run to evil, 
and they hasten to shed innocent blood. 
Their thoughts \textit{are} thoughts of iniquity; 
devastation and destruction \textit{are} in their highways.
\verse They do not know \textit{the} way of peace, 
and there is no justice in their firm paths. 
They have made their paths crooked for themselves; 
everyone \textit{who walks} in it knows no peace.
\verse Therefore justice is far from us, 
and righteousness does not reach us. 
We wait for light, but look! \textit{there is} darkness; 
for brightness, \textit{but} we walk in darkness.
\verse We grope like the blind \textit{along} a wall, 
and we grope \textit{as without} eyes. 
We stumble at noon as \textit{in} the twilight; 
among the strong \textit{we are} like the dead.
\verse We all groan like bears, 
and we coo mutteringly like doves. 
We wait for justice, but there is none; 
for salvation, \textit{but} it is far from us.
\verse For our transgressions are numerous before you, 
and our sins \textit{testify} against us. 
Indeed, our transgressions \textit{are} with us, 
and we know our iniquities:
\verse transgressing and denying Adonai, 
and turning \textit{away from following} our God; 
speaking oppression and falsehood, 
conceiving and uttering words of deception from \textit{the} heart.
\verse And justice is pushed back, 
and righteousness stands afar; 
for truth stumbles in the public square, 
and straightforwardness is unable to enter,
\verse and truth is missing, 
and he who turns aside from evil \textit{is} plundered. 
And Adonai saw, 
and it was displeasing in his eyes that there was no justice
\verse And he saw that there was no man, 
and he was appalled that there was no one who intercedes, 
so his arm came to assist him, 
and his righteousness \textit{was what} sustained him.
\verse And he put on righteousness like \textit{a} breastplate, 
and a helmet of salvation on his head, 
and he put on garments of vengeance \textit{for} clothing, 
and he wrapped \textit{himself in} zeal as \textit{in a} robe.
\verse According to deeds, so he will repay; 
wrath to his enemies, requital to those who are his \textit{enemies}. 
He will repay requital to the coastlands.
\verse So they shall fear the name of Adonai from \textit{the} west, 
and his glory from the sunrise, 
for he will come like \textit{a} narrow stream; 
the wind of Adonai drives it on.
\verse “And a redeemer will come to Zion, 
to those in Jacob who turn away from transgression,” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “And as for me, this \textit{is} my covenant with them, says Adonai: my spirit that \textit{is} upon you, 
and my words that I have placed in your mouth 
shall not depart from your mouth, 
or from the mouths of your \textit{children}, 
or from the mouths of \textit{your children’s children},” 
says Adonai, “from now on and forever.”

and all those who treated you disrespectfully shall bow down at the soles of your feet. 
And they shall call you the city of Adonai, 
Zion \textit{of} the holy one of Israel.
\verse Instead of you being forsaken 
and hated \textit{with no one passing through,} 
I will \textit{make} you an everlasting \textit{object of pride}, 
a joy of \textit{coming generations}.
\verse And you shall suck \textit{the} milk of nations, 
and suck \textit{the} breast of kings, 
and you shall know that I \textit{am} Adonai your Savior, 
and your Redeemer, the Strong One of Jacob.
\verse Instead of bronze I will bring gold,

and instead of wood, bronze, 
and instead of stones, iron. 
And I will \textit{appoint} peace \textit{as} your overseer, 
and righteousness \textit{as} \textit{your ruling body}.

devastation or destruction on your borders. 
And you shall call your walls Salvation, 
and your gates, Praise.
\verse The sun shall no longer be your light by day, 
and for bright light the moon shall not give you light, 
but Adonai will be your everlasting light,

before labor pains came to her, she gave birth to a son.
\verse Who has heard \textit{anything} like this? 
Who has seen \textit{anything} like these \textit{things}? 
Can a land be born in one day? 
Or can a nation be born in a moment? \textit{Yet} when she was in labor, Zion indeed gave birth \textit{to} her children.
\verse Shall I myself I break open and not \textit{deliver}?” says Adonai, 
“or I who \textit{delivers} lock up \textit{the womb}?” says your God.
\verse “Rejoice with Jerusalem 
and shout in exultation with her, all those who love her! 
Rejoice with her \textit{in} joy, all those who mourn over her,
\verse so that you may suck and be satisfied from her \textit{consoling breast}, 
so that you may drink deeply and refresh yourselves from her \textit{heavy breast}.”
\verse For thus says Adonai:
\verse “Look! I \textit{am} about to spread prosperity out to her like a river, 
and \textit{the} wealth of \textit{the} nations like an overflowing stream, 
and you shall suck and be carried on the hip; 
and you shall you shall be played with on the knees.
\verseWithHeading{Adonai’s Final Judgment} And you shall see and your heart shall rejoice, 
and your bones shall \textit{flourish} like the grass, 
and the hand of Adonai shall make itself known \textit{to} his servants, 
and he shall curse his enemies.
\verse For look! Adonai will come in fire, 
and his chariots like the storm wind, 
to \textit{give back} his anger in wrath, 
and his rebuke in flames of fire.
\verse For Adonai enters into judgment \textit{on} all flesh with fire and his sword, 
and \textit{those slain by} Adonai shall be many.
\verse Those who sanctify themselves 
and those who cleanse themselves \textit{to go into} the gardens after \textit{the} one in the middle, 
eating the flesh of swine 
and detestable things and rodents together shall come to an end!” \textit{declares} Adonai.
\verse “And I—their works and thoughts!—\textit{am} about to come to gather all nations and tongues, 
and they shall come and see my glory.
\verse And I will set a sign among them, 
and I will send survivors from them to the nations: 
Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw \textit{the} bow; 
Tubal and Javan, the faraway coastlands 
that have not heard \textit{of} my fame, 
and have not seen my glory.
\verse And they shall declare my glory among the nations,
\verse and bring all your countrymen from all the nations \textit{as} an offering to Adonai on horses and chariots and in litters and on mules and camels, to \textit{my holy mountain}, Jerusalem,” says Adonai, “just as the sons of Israel bring \textit{an} offering in a clean vessel \textit{to} the house of Adonai.
\verse And indeed, I will take some of them as priests \textit{and} the Levites,” says Adonai.
\verse And this shall happen: From \textit{new moon to new moon} and from \textit{Sabbath to Sabbath} all flesh shall come to bow in worship before me,” says Adonai.
\verse “And they shall go out and look at the corpses of the people \textit{who have rebelled} against me, for their worm shall not die, 
and their fire shall not be quenched, 
and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.”
