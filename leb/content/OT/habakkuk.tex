\verseWithHeading{Habakkuk’s Complaint} The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw.
\verse O Adonai, how long shall I cry for help 
and you will not listen? 
\textit{How long} will I cry out to you, “Violence!” 
and you will not save?
\verse Why do you cause me to see evil 
\textit{while} you look at trouble? 
Destruction and violence happen before me; 
contention and strife arise.
\verse Therefore the law is paralyzed, 
and justice does not go forth perpetually. 
For the wicked surround the righteous; 
therefore justice goes forth perverted.
\verseWithHeading{God’s Answer to Habakkuk} “Look among the nations and see; 
be astonished and astounded. 
For a work \textit{is about to} be done in your days 
that you will not believe if it is told.
\verse For look! I am raising up the Chaldeans, 
the bitter and impetuous nation, 
the one who walks through the spacious places of earth 
to take possession of dwellings not belonging to it.
\verse They \textit{are} dreadful and awesome; 
their justice and their dignity proceed from themselves.
\verse Their horses \textit{are} more swift than leopards; 
they are more menacing than wolves \textit{at} dusk. 
Their horsemen gallop; their horsemen come from afar; 
they fly like an eagle \textit{that is} swift to devour.
\verse All of them come for violence, 
their faces pressing forward. 
They gather captives like the sand.
\verse And they themselves scoff at kings 
and rulers \textit{are} a joke to them. 
They laugh at every fortification, 
and they heap up earth and take it.
\verse Then they sweep \textit{like the} wind and pass on; 
they become guilty, whose might \textit{is} their god!”
\verseWithHeading{Habakkuk’s Second Complaint} Are you not from of old, 
O Adonai my God, my Holy One? 
You shall not die. 
O Adonai, you have marked them for judgment; 
O Rock, you have established them for reproof.
\verse Your eyes \textit{are} too pure to see evil, 
and you are not able to look at wrongdoing. 
Why do you look at the treacherous? 
\textit{Why} are you silent when the wicked swallows up 
\textit{someone} more righteous than him?
\verse You make humankind like fish of the sea, 
like crawling creatures that have no ruler among them.
\verse He brings up all of them with a fishhook; 
he drags them up with a fishnet; 
he gathers them in his dragnet. 
Therefore, he rejoices and exults.
\verse Therefore he sacrifices to his fishnet 
and makes offerings to his dragnet, 
for by them \textit{he makes a good living} 
and his food \textit{is} rich.
\verse Will he therefore empty his fishnet 
and continually kill nations without showing mercy?

\verseWithHeading{The Righteous Will Live by Faith} I will stand at my post, 
and station myself on \textit{the} rampart. 
And I will keep watch to see what he will say to me, 
and what he will answer concerning my complaint.
\verse Then Adonai answered me and said, 
“Write \textit{the} vision and make \textit{it} plain on the tablet 
so that \textit{it might be read quickly}.
\verse For \textit{there is} yet a vision for the appointed time; 
it will give witness to the end, and it will not lie. 
If it tarries, wait for it, 
for it will surely come and not delay.
\verse Look! His spirit within him is puffed up; 
it is not upright. 
But the righteous shall live by his faithfulness.
\verse \textit{How much less} the defiant; 
\textit{the} arrogant, treacherous man? 
He who broadens his throat like Sheol, 
and who, like death, is not satisfied, 
and who gathers to himself all the nations, 
and harvested for himself all the peoples, 
will not succeed.
\verse Shall not all of these take up a taunt against him, 
with ridicule and riddles against him, saying, 
‘Woe to him who heaps up what is not his’? 
\textit{For} how long? 
And, ‘\textit{Woe to him} who makes himself heavy with pledges’?
\verse Will not your creditors suddenly rise up 
and awaken those who make you tremble? 
Then you shall be as plunder for them.
\verse Because you plundered many nations, 
all the remaining nations will plunder you 
on account of the blood of humanity 
and violence \textit{against the} land, 
\textit{and against} cities and all who live in them.
\verse Woe to \textit{him who} obtains profit \textit{from} evil gain for his house, 
to set his nest on high, 
to be saved from the hand of misfortune!
\verse You have plotted shame for your house, 
cutting off many peoples 
and sinning against your life.
\verse For the stone will cry out from the wall, 
and \textit{the} plaster from \textit{the} wood will answer it.
\verse Woe to \textit{him who} builds a city by bloodguilt, 
and \textit{who} founds a city by wickedness!
\verse Look! \textit{Is it} not from Adonai of hosts 
that people labor for mere fire, 
and nations exhaust themselves for mere vanity?
\verse For the earth will be filled 
with the knowledge of the glory of Adonai, 
like the waters covering the sea.
\verse Woe to \textit{him who} gives a drink to his neighbors, 
pouring out your wrath and also making \textit{them} drunk 
in order to see their nakedness!
\verse You will be sated with shame rather than glory. 
Drink also yourself, and expose yourself! 
The cup of the right hand of Adonai 
will come around upon you 
and disgrace upon your glory.
\verse For \textit{the} violence of Lebanon will cover you, 
and \textit{the} destruction of wild animals will shatter them 
on account of the blood of humanity, 
and \textit{the} violence \textit{against the} land, 
\textit{against} a city and all the inhabitants in it.
\verse What value \textit{is} an idol 
when its carver has fashioned it, 
a molten idol, a teacher of lies? 
For \textit{he who} fashioned his creation trusts in it, 
\textit{though} making mute idols!
\verse Woe to \textit{him who} says to the wood, ‘Wake up!’ 
\textit{And} to a lifeless stone, ‘Arise!’ 
Can he teach? 
Look, it is covered \textit{with} gold and silver, 
and there is no breath within it.
\verse But Adonai \textit{is} in his holy temple. 
Let all the earth be silent before him.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Habakkuk 3
\verseWithHeading{The Prayer of Habakkuk} A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth.
\verse O Adonai, I have heard the report of you; 
O Adonai, I stand in awe of your works. 
In the midst of the years, revive it! 
In the midst of the years, make \textit{it} known! 
In wrath, may you remember to show compassion.
\verse God came from Teman; 
the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah 
His splendor covers the heavens, 
and his praise fills the earth.
\verse And his brightness was like \textit{the} light; 
flashing rays \textit{came} from his hand for him; 
And there \textit{is} the covering of his strength.
\verse Before him went Disease, 
and Pestilence went out at his feet.
\verse He stood and measured the earth; 
he looked and made the nations tremble. 
Then the mountains of old were shattered; 
the hills of old collapsed. 
The ways of old belong to him.
\verse Under affliction I saw the tents of Cushan; 
the tent curtains of the land of Midian trembled.
\verse Was the anger of Adonai against the rivers? 
Was your wrath against the rivers, 
or your fury against the sea, 
when you mounted upon your horses, 
upon your victory chariot?
\verse You laid bare the nakedness of your bow, 
swearing oaths \textit{with the} arrows of \textit{your} word. 
You split the earth \textit{with} rivers.
\verse \textit{When the} mountains saw you they writhed; 
a torrent of waters swept by; 
the deep gave its voice; 
it raised its hands on high.
\verse Sun \textit{and} moon stood still in \textit{their} place; 
at the light of your arrows they moved about; 
at the gleam of the flashing of your spear.
\verse In fury you marched through \textit{the} earth; 
in anger you trampled the nations.
\verse You went forth for the salvation of your people, 
for the salvation of your anointed. 
You crushed the head of the house of wickedness, 
laying bare \textit{from the} foundation to the top.
\verse You pierced the head of his warriors with his own arrows; 
they came like a whirlwind to scatter me, 
their exultation like \textit{one who} devours the afflicted in ambush.
\verse You trampled upon the sea \textit{with} your horses, 
the churning of many waters.
\verse I hear and my stomach shakes; 
my lips quiver at the sound; 
infection enters my bones; 
that which \textit{is} beneath me trembles; 
I wait quietly for the day of trouble 
to come upon the people attacking us.
\verse Though the fig tree \textit{does} not blossom, 
nor there be fruit on the vines; 
the yield of \textit{the} olive tree fails, 
and the cultivated fields do not yield food; 
\textit{the} flock is cut off from the animal pen, 
and there is no cattle in the stalls,
\verse Yet I will rejoice in Adonai; 
I will exult in the God of my salvation.
\verse Adonai, my Lord, \textit{is} my strength; 
he makes my feet like the deer; 
he causes me to walk on my high places. 
To the choirmaster with stringed instruments.
