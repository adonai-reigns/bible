\verse \textit{An oracle}. The word of Adonai to Israel \textit{through} Malachi.
\verseWithHeading{An Oracle Against Edom} “I have loved you,” says Adonai, but you say, “How have you loved us?” “\textit{Is} Esau not Jacob’s brother?” \textit{declares} Adonai. “I have loved Jacob,
\verse but Esau I have hated. I have made his mountain ranges a desolation, and \textit{given} his inheritance to the jackals of \textit{the} desert.”
\verse If Edom says, “We are shattered, but we will return and rebuild \textit{the} ruins,” Adonai of hosts says this: “They may build, but I will tear down; and they will be called a territory of wickedness, and the people \textit{with} whom Adonai is angry forever.”
\verse Your eyes will see \textit{this}, and you will say, “Adonai is great beyond the borders of Israel.”
\verseWithHeading{An Oracle Against the Temple Priesthood} “A son honors \textit{his} father, and a slave his master; but if I \textit{am} a father, where \textit{is} my honor, and if I \textit{am} a master, where \textit{is} my reverence?” says Adonai of hosts to you, O priests, \textit{who despise} my name. “But you say, ‘How have we despised your name?’
\verse \textit{You are} presenting defiled food on my altar! But you ask, ‘How have we defiled you?’ By saying \textit{that} the table of Adonai is despised!
\verse When you offer a blind \textit{animal} for sacrifice, is that not wrong? And when you offer \textit{the} lame and the one who is ill, is that not wrong? Present it, please, to your governor! Will he be pleased with you? \textit{Will he show you favor}?” says Adonai of hosts.
\verse So then, \textit{implore the favor of God} so that he will be gracious to us. “\textit{This is what you have done}. \textit{Will he show favor to any of you}?” says Adonai of hosts.
\verse “Who also among you will shut \textit{the temple} doors \textit{so that} you will not kindle fire in vain \textit{on} my altar? I take no pleasure in you,” says Adonai of hosts, “and \textit{I will not accept} an offering from your hand.
\verse From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name \textit{is} great among the nations, and in every place incense \textit{is} being presented to my name, and a pure offering. For my name \textit{is} great among the nations,” says Adonai of hosts.
\verse “But you \textit{are} profaning it by saying the table of the Lord \textit{is} defiled, and its fruit—its food—is despised!
\verse And you say, ‘Look! \textit{This is} a weariness,’ and you sniff \textit{with disdain} at it,” says Adonai of hosts. “And you bring \textit{the} stolen, the lame, and the one that is sick—\textit{this} you bring as the offering! Should I \textit{accept it} from your hand?” says Adonai.
\verse “Cursed is the one who cheats, who has in his flock a male and vows \textit{it}, but \textit{instead} sacrifices a blemished one to the Lord! For I \textit{am} a great king,” says Adonai of hosts, “and my name \textit{is} awesome among the nations.”

\begin{biblechapter} % Malachi 2
\verse “And so then, O priests, this command \textit{is} for you:
\verse If you will not listen, and if you will not \textit{take it to heart} to give glory to my name,” says Adonai of hosts, “then I will send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings; moreover I have \textit{already} cursed them because \textit{you are not taking it to heart}.
\verse Look! I \textit{am} going to rebuke \textit{your offspring}, and I will scatter offal on your faces, \textit{the} offal of your religious feasts, and you will be carried to it.
\verse “Then you will know that I have sent to you this command, that my covenant with Levi \textit{continues},” says Adonai of hosts.
\verse “My covenant with him was \textit{one of} life and peace, and I gave them to him. \textit{This required} reverence, and he revered me and stood in awe \textit{before} my name.
\verse \textit{The} instruction of truth was in his mouth, and wickedness was not found on his lips. In peace and in uprightness he walked with me, and he brought back many from sin.
\verse For the lips of \textit{the} priest should guard knowledge, and they should seek instruction from his mouth, for he \textit{is} the messenger of Adonai of hosts.
\verse But you, you have turned from the way; you have caused many to stumble by \textit{your} instruction; you have ruined the covenant of Levi,” says Adonai of hosts.
\verse “And in turn I have made you despised and humbled before all the people, inasmuch as you \textit{are} not keeping my way, but are \textit{favoring your own instruction}.”
\verseWithHeading{Adonai Hates Faithlessness} \textit{Do we not all have} one father? Has not one God created us? Why \textit{then} are we unfaithful \textit{to one another}, profaning the covenant of our ancestors?
\verse Judah has been faithless, and a detestable thing has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem. Judah has profaned the sanctuary of Adonai which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
\verse May Adonai cut off from the tents of Jacob the man who does this, \textit{the} one who is awake and \textit{who} answers, and \textit{the one who} brings an offering to Adonai of hosts!
\verse And this you do \textit{as well}: \textit{you} cover the altar of Adonai \textit{with} tears, \textit{with} weeping and \textit{with} groaning, because he \textit{no longer regards the offering} or accepts \textit{it} \textit{with} favor from your hand.
\verse But you ask, “\textit{For what reason}?” Because Adonai stands as a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have been unfaithful, even though she \textit{is} your marriage partner and \textit{your wife by covenant}.
\verse \textit{Did not one God make them?} But a remnant of \textit{the} spirit is his. And what does the one \textit{God} desire? An offspring of God. \textit{You must be attentive to} your spirit, and you must not be unfaithful to the wife of your youth.
\verse “For \textit{I} hate divorce,” says Adonai, the God of Israel, “and he \textit{who} covers his clothing \textit{with} violence,” says Adonai of hosts. “\textit{You must be attentive to} your spirit and you must not be unfaithful.”
\verse You have wearied Adonai with your words, but you ask, “With what have we wearied \textit{him}?” \textit{You have done so} \textit{when you say}, “Everyone who does evil \textit{is} good in the \textit{sight} of Adonai, and in them he delights,” or “Where \textit{is} the God of justice?”

\verseWithHeading{Adonai’s Messenger is Coming} “Look! I \textit{am} going to send my messenger, and he will prepare \textit{the} way \textit{before me}. And the Lord whom you \textit{are} seeking will come suddenly to his temple, and the messenger of the covenant, \textit{in} whom you \textit{are} taking pleasure—look!—\textit{he is} about to come,” says Adonai of hosts.
\verse And who \textit{can} endure the day of his coming? And who \textit{is} the one who can stand \textit{when he appears}? For he \textit{is} like a refiner’s fire, like launderers’ alkali.
\verse He will sit \textit{as} a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify the children of Levi, and he will refine them like gold and like silver, and they will present to Adonai offerings in righteousness.
\verse And the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to Adonai, like \textit{in the} days of old and like \textit{in} former years.
\verse “Then I will approach you for judgment, and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers, and against those who swear \textit{falsely}, and against the oppressors of \textit{the} hired worker \textit{with his} wages, \textit{the} widow and \textit{the} orphan, and \textit{the abusers of} \textit{the} alien, and \textit{yet} do not fear me,” says Adonai of hosts.
\verseWithHeading{An Overflowing Blessing} “For I, Adonai, have not changed, and you, O children of Jacob, have not perished.
\verse From the days of your ancestors you have turned aside from my rules, and have not kept \textit{them}! Return to me and I will return to you,” says Adonai of hosts, “but you say, ‘How shall we return?’
\verse Will a human \textit{dare to} rob God? Yet you \textit{are} robbing me! And you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In the tithes and the contributions!
\verse You \textit{are} being cursed with \textit{a} curse, for you \textit{are} robbing me, the whole nation \textit{of you}!
\verse Bring the whole tithe to \textit{the storehouse}, so that there will be food in my house, and test me please in this,” says Adonai of hosts, “if I will not open for you the windows of heaven, and pour forth for you \textit{an overflowing blessing}.
\verse I will rebuke the devourer for you; it will not destroy the fruit of your soil; your vine in the field will not be unfruitful,” says Adonai of hosts.
\verse “And all the nations will call you blessed, because you will be \textit{a land in which one takes joy},” says Adonai of hosts.
\verse “Your words have been harsh against me,” says Adonai. “But you say, ‘How have we spoken together against you?’
\verse You have said, ‘\textit{It is} useless to serve God! What \textit{is the} gain if we keep his requirements, and if we walk as mourners \textit{before} Adonai of hosts?
\verse And now we \textit{are} calling \textit{the} arrogant blessed! Not only do those who do wickedness prosper; they also test God and they escape!’ ”
\verseWithHeading{A Book of Remembrance is Written} Then those who revered Adonai spoke \textit{with one another}. And Adonai listened attentively and heard, and a scroll of remembrance was written \textit{before him} of those who revere Adonai and ponder his name.
\verse “They will be mine,” says Adonai of hosts, “on the day that I \textit{am} acting, \textit{my} treasured possession. I will have compassion on them as a man has compassion on his son who serves him.
\verse You will return and see \textit{the difference} between \textit{the} righteous and \textit{the} wicked, between \textit{the one who} serves God and the one who does not serve him.

\verse  “For look! The day \textit{is} about to come, burning like an oven, and all the arrogant and every \textit{evildoer} will be stubble. The coming day will consume them,” says Adonai of hosts. “It will not leave behind for them root or branch.
\verse But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise, with healing in its wings, and you will go out and leap like \textit{fattened calves}.
\verse You will trample down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I \textit{am} going to act,” says Adonai of hosts.
\verse “Remember the instruction of my servant Moses, which I commanded him at Horeb to all Israel, the rules and regulations.
\verse Look! I \textit{am} going to send to you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and awesome day of Adonai!
\verse And he will bring back \textit{the} hearts of \textit{the} fathers to \textit{the} sons, and the hearts of \textit{the} sons to their fathers, so that I will not come and strike the land \textit{with} a ban.”
